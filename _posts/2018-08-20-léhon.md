<p>On the boat ride described in the Dinan post, I showed some pictures of Léhon, which we passed on the ride. The town, especially the abby there, intrigued us and so the next day, we took the 20-minute walk from our hotel to Léhon. We found the abby, walked around it and the town, then walked along the Rance river back to Dinan. </p>

<h3>Abbaye St. Magliore</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Abbaye of Saint Magliore was founded in the 12th century and survived until the French Revolution (1789). Since then it has gone through several lives and now survives as the church, where services are still held (occasionally) and a conference/exhibition center, using the other buildings that were part of the Abbaye. We found it to be a beautiful and peaceful place and were glad that we'd seen it the day before and made the effort to visit it.</p>

<p>We see this a lot: campers (called caravans here) with all that's needed for any opportunity. Find a nice place to picque-nique? Pull out the table, the chairs and you are ready!</p>
