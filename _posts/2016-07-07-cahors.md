To wrap up our first ramble, we went to the town of Cahors. There's nothing particularly enticing about Cahors, but it is a good place to see some local sights. Yet, Cahors itself has some charms, among them, wine made from the malbec grape and renowned for its darkness. That's true; the wine we had was almost black, and while not up to Bordeaux or Burgundy standards, darn good. There's a surprise: good wine in France...

Anyway, here are some sights from Cahors. I'll post about a couple of day-trips we made from here over the next couple days.

	<figcaption><em>These steps, on Pont Valentré, have seen some feet. I guess in 800 years some wear can be expected.</em></figcaption>

	<figcaption><em>A slightly more modern bridge. I am realizing that I really like bridges: they can be beautiful and they're all marvels of engineering.</em></figcaption>

	<figcaption><em>Cahors is essentially a peninsula, wrapped on three sides by the Tarn River. Walking along the river is lovely.</em></figcaption>

	<figcaption><em>The old part of Cahors is known for its narrow streets. These are not much changed over the last six or seven centuries.</em></figcaption>

	<figcaption><em>Gotta love it: want to have a reception for your business? Set up some tables in the street and have at it.</em></figcaption>

	<figcaption><em>Cahors is also known for its "hidden gardens" which didn't seem very hidden to us. They're all over, a pleasant interlude in the city.</em></figcaption>
</figure>



That's Cahors. Not a place high on our list for another visit, but we enjoyed our stay here very much. Next up: two day trips, one to the beautiful cloister in Moissac and another an amble along the Tarn River to the west of Cahors.
