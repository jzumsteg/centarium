<p>Last week we took two days with Mary and Gilles to visit two sites associated with Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. One day was interesting and enjoyable, the other, not so much. A quick report...</p>

<h3>Essoyes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pierre-August Renoir spent summers from 1894 to his death in 1919 in the small town of Essoyes (pronounced "Esswa"). His wife Aline and his favorite model Gabrielle were from Essoyes (they were cousins) and in 1894, when Renoir had become successful - meaning he had money - he bought a house and garden there. The town, which is not doing so well (more on that later), decided to capitalize on his life there. They built an exhibition center with stories and pictures of the family life in Essoyes, and purchased and restored Renoir's house and studio. First, some pictures of the town.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>COVID-19 in France</h2>
Some folks have asked about France and COVID, so I'll write a bit about how France is handling it. After a terrible start 18 months ago, France clamped down like crazy: people could not leave their homes between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., except for one hour of exercise within a kilometer (0.6 miles) of home or to go for food or a medical appointment. It worked: France's infection rates fell dramatically and the lockdown was lifted. Then Delta hit earlier this year and things got worse quickly (like almost everywhere in the world) so a mask mandate was put back into effect. (The vaccination rate here is better than the U.S. and way better than all those Southern/Midwestern states that are <em>bragging</em> about how low their vaccination rates are. Don't get me started on that).

Then the French government instituted a Health Pass that holds a person's vaccination record on a smartphone. To get into an area that requires full vaccination, the person shows the pass on their cellphone and a person at the location scans the code. French people have to show that to get into restaurants or museums, etc. We have seen a restaurant turn away people without the Pass.&nbsp;

Until late last month, we could not get a <em>pass sanitaire<em> but the French government found a way for people from a number of countries to get one. Last week, we were able to do that (in a remarkably easy online process) and now we're set.

In addition to needing a <em>pass sanitaire</em> to get into restaurants, bars, cafés, and so forth, everyone has to wear a mask in those places, in any enclosed space (stores, for instance) and public transportation. And honestly, <em>everyone</em> does it. Maybe because there is a $150 fine for not doing it; that concentrates the mind. The central government here is stronger than in the United States; when the government issues such a mandate, it has the power to enforce it and it does so. The&nbsp;<em>departments</em> - a rough equivalent to our states - have no ability to override it.

France currently is at about 65% of the eligible population fully vaccinated, the United States around 55% (source for both numbers: Reuters). Here though, the number of new infections leveled off as soon as the mask mandate went into effect, and is now declining; not so in the United States where the number of new infections continues to climb. Maybe that mask mandate and health pass actually work, eh?

The result of all this is that hospitals are not overwhelmed with new cases. It's worse than it was a couple months ago, but nowhere near a problem.

You may have read of large demonstrations ("<em>manifestationes</em>" or "<em>manifs</em>") in Paris protesting that Health Pass. Keep in mind that the French believe protesting something is their God-given right and will do so at the drop of a hat. Rarely does a week go by in Paris without someone protesting something. Because this is such an ingrained belief, French people, when polled, will often show full-throated support for the right to protest, even if they don't support the cause of the protest. There's really not much resistance to what the government is doing. That it's working well may be a factor...

We have decided that the best was to avoid getting sick is to drink copious amounts of wine. Red, white, rosé, sparkling - doesn't matter. We haven't gotten sick yet, so it clearly works.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In blog posts of previous trips here I've written some about Bois-le-Roi, which is where we stay when we do one of the long-stay trips. But maybe there are some new people to this blog and who haven't fled yet, so I'm going to post a short description of Bois-le-Roi (and at the end, I'll include links to earlier posts about this town).

Bois-le-Roi ("forest of the king") is about 35 miles south of Paris. About 6,000 live here, and an important attraction is that Bois-le-Roi has a station the railroad line to Paris. That trip takes about 35 minutes, with one stop, and trains run almost every half hour. That makes Bois-le-Roi desirable place to live. It also makes it a desirable place to park for a commuter and that can be a problem!

The town has been settled forever; there are Roman records from 52 B.C. indicating a settlement here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If anyone reading this blog has ever heard of Hartmannswillerkopf, I will be astounded. We hadn't heard of it, saw a sign. to "Vieil Armand" and thought it might be an old village in the Vosges Mountains. So we drove up, up up to it and found Hartmannswillerkopf, a monument to a World War I battle fought here, with a cemetery for soldiers, both French and German, who died on this lonely mountain-top.

The battle here, started Christmas Day of 1914 and continuing for almost two years, was like almost every World War I battle -&nbsp; a lot of sound and fury at the beginning to establish the front lines, then years of small battles, none of which gained more than a couple hundred yards. Here, the gains and losses were more like a couple hundred feet at the most.

And the cost: about 5,000 French soldiers and 2,500 German soldiers.&nbsp;

Once the lines settled, most troops were transferred from here to the lines in the Ardenne Forest and along the Somme River where the war had settled into a much larger version of the slog at this place. The battles at Hartmannswillerkopf were largely symbolic, accomplishing no military objectives. Yet men continued to be killed here, for nothing.

After the war, this cemetery was established for French soldiers who had died here and at other battlefields in the Vosges Mountains. There are 35,000 soldiers here, either buried or in an ossuary. German soldiers were buried in a nearby-town cemetery.

I find these cemeteries deeply touching. These were boys, essentially, eighteen or nineteen or twenty years old. I walk among the graves, and always give them a sharp military salute for their sacrifice.

In 2014 the French and German Presidents marked the 100 year anniversary of the start of World War I by laying the first stone of a memorial here at Hartmannswillerkopf. That memorial says that this place is now dedicated to French-German friendship. I will leave to you the irony of 35,000 soldiers, who died in a war between France and Germany, lying in a cemetery dedicated to the friendship between those two countries.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Laurie and I plan to spend four to five months in France in 2013, with side trips to, oh, Spain, Italy, Germany and, well, anywhere that interests us. We invite you to share our journey.

We started thinking about doing this several years ago. Initially, we hoped to be able to stay a year, but logistics got in the way: finding something to do with our house here was the big one. And finances played a role, too. Committing to a year, and then finding that it was way more expensive than we planned would have been a problem. So we decided to shoot for four or five months in 2013. If health and finances hold out, we'll try to spend three or four or five months a year in France or Spain or somewhere else as long as we can do it. For now though, we're hoping to leave in mid-May and return at the end of September or October in 2013.

We are good friends with two couples who live about 35 minutes south of Paris. <em>Les Germains</em> - Mary and Gilles - live in Chartrettes; we've visited them every trip for years, stayed with them in Chartrettes and traveled in France and Spain with them. We met <em>Les Rufin</em> - Hervé and Jamie - through Mary and Gilles. They live in Samois-sur-Seine<em>, </em>just a few minutes away from Chartrettes. We always see them a couple times when we're in Chartrettes and have come to know them and their family well. Both are on the lookout for a place for us to stay near them, as we love the area, and can jump on a train and be in Paris in 40 minutes. We think that area - near Fontainebleau - will be perfect,and it will be so great to be close to Mary and Gilles and Jamie and Hervé. We are looking forward to many good times (wine will be involved).

That's the plan. Now to make it work!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have a place to stay on our France sojourn! At the suggestion of our friends, we joined the Anglophone organization in the area we want to stay in, and put an advertisement in their newsletter. A fellow who has a house in Montigny-sur-Loing, about fifteen minutes south of Fontainbleau, responded. He has a three-bedroom house, fully furnished, in this small village. The house looks wonderful, with an enclosed yard and room for Craig and Annie and Clara to stay with us when they visit. It's about a ten-minute walk to the train station, where trains leave for Paris every hour - about a 55-minute trip. Monday, Jamie and Hervé Rufin, our friends in nearby Samois-sur-Seine, visited the house to check it out for us, and pronounced it comfortable and livable. Good enough for us!

Here are some pictures of the house we'll call home for<span style="line-height: 24px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 24px;">at almost five</span> months next year.[gallery]

Laurie and I have long said that we really love the small villages of France (which does not, of course, mean that we don't also love Paris; we do!) and that we'd like to live in one for a while. Montigny-sur-Loing certainly fits that description: it's about 2,600 people, one main street, bordered on the north by the Fontainebleau forest and on the south by the Loing River (it's large enough to have two pizza places, fortunately; gotta love a nice Italian pizza in a small French town). Maybe after a few months we'll decide that visiting a beautiful village and actually living in one are two different things, but...we'll take that risk.

Now that we've found the house for next summer, we just need to wrap up a few minor details: booking flights, leasing a car, packing for five months, and learning French. Piece of cake!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We realized a couple days ago that we have to have visas to stay in France as long as we want to stay. France is part of the "Shengen" area - so named for the Shengen Treaty that covers this stuff - which includes almost all European countries.  A traveler can stay only 90 days in the "Shengen" area in a 180-day period. When a traveler arrives in his/her first Shengen country, both the 90-day and 180-day clocks start ticking. If a traveler reaches the 90-day visit limit before the 180-day clock runs out, he or she is legally not allowed to stay in any Shengen country until the 180 days is up. Doesn't work to leave to another country and come back; that 180-day clock for the entire European area prevents that.

Now, my research finds a number of people who say it's no big deal to overstay that 90-day limit. First, it's unlikely that a country will track down someone who has overstayed, so the only time they'll check is at Passport Control in the way out of the country. Second, most reports of people who overstayed say that there was no problem at Passport Control on the way out, that the people there didn't even look at the dates on which they entered the area. And third, most people who were identified at Passport Control as overstaying reported that the agents took no action. So, thought I, no reason to worry; we'll just overstay by about 50 days and hope for the best on the way out.

But...here's the problem: some people did report problems and those problems were serious, and a number of people report that Shengen countries have recently really picked up enforcement of the 90-day stay limit. What has been reported? Several reported being detained at Immigration Control long enough to miss a flight home. Others reported that their passport was stamped to indicate that they had overstayed and that they were not to be re-admitted to the Shengen area for ten years!

Now that last one really got our attention, as we hope to travel and stay in Europe for years to come. But also, we thought about being there for four or five months, worrying the entire time about what was going to happen on the way out of the country. So we decided to go legal and get what are called "Long-Stay Visas."

Hence, our introduction to French bureaucracy. Here is what we have to do to get a Long-Stay Visa:

Gather a ton of information, including birth certificates, marriage certificate, financial statements, notarized letters saying that we won't work (we're retired! Why would we want to work?), rental agreements, proof of medical insurance (including emergency medical evacuation insurance), and a few other things. Then we have to fly to San Francisco for a face-to-face interview at the French Consulate. We give them $140 for each visa and, if all goes well, three weeks later we receive our visas. Then when we're in France, we have to register with the Office of Immigration and Integration, have a meeting there at which we will receive a medical inspection (chest x-ray, blood draw and who-knows-what-else), pay them $450 per visa and finally, receive the stamps that will allow us to stay for up to a year. Total cost, including air fare to San Francisco: somewhere around $1,000 each. Made us think, for about ten seconds, of changing plans and returning at the 90-day limit. But, what the heck, we thought, we can do this, it's only money, and it'll be nice to not have to worry while we're there.

But...sheesh!

(Added post-trip:) We did not get these visas, on the advice of friends in France who said they <i>never</i> have had trouble traveling in and out of Europe on American passports, even though their stays may be a year or more. Leaving France, after 145 days on the 90-day visa we were a little nervous, but the officer in passport control at Charles DeGaulle airport didn't even look for the entry stamp; he found an empty page in our passports, stamped us out and that was that.

(Added during our 2018 trip:) We have overstayed our visas three times now, once 145 days, once 137 days and once 91 days. Never had the slightest problem on leaving. The immigration agent takes oru passport, finds a empty page, and stamps us out. This year it will be about 135 days; I hope our luck holds.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're ready! Got our flights booked and leased a car for the time we're there.

Flights are on British Airways, Seattle - London, couple hours in Heathrow, then Heathrow - Paris. We'll get in around 5 in the afternoon. Mary and Gilles will be there to meet us; we think they'll bring a large delivery van to carry our luggage. British Airways allows one large suitcase each, and then charges $50 for the second large suitcase, which is much less than shipping a suitcase-sized box of stuff over ($180). So we're going to have four big-as-allowed suitcases.

We are leasing a car from Renault. Renault, and other European auto companies, have a plan whereby you can do a short-term lease (at least 21 days); you get a brand-new car, fully-insured, for quite a good rate. It's not a great deal if you're staying for a shorter stay because the rate is high for the first 21 days, but after that, it's $18 per day, fully insured. For our stay, that works out to be almost exactly $25 per day for the five months, and that is an unbeatable rate. Our car will be a Clio4 (you can see it at http://www.renault.fr/gamme-renault/mini-sites-vehicules/nouvelle-clio-IV/), which Gilles says is a new model, and a very nice car. It will get somewhere around 40 mpg, which will be just fine with us, as diesel is about $7 per gallon (regular gasoline is about $8). (Post-trip edit: diesel was about $7.50 per gallon, and our Clio4 got just a touch under 50 miles per gallon for the time we were there. We <i>loved</i> that car: it was a little sporty, handled like a sports car, was quite peppy, and bright red!)

And, it has GPS! That alone is worth the price!

So, we have a house, a car and airline tickets. Now we just have to learn French. Actually, we'll be taking French lessons the first month we're there; all we want is to have reasonable restaurant/train station/hotel capabilities; we'll see...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was talking to a fellow today and he said that he and his wife were planning a trip to Paris for 2014. He asked me, after hearing that we'd been there quite a few times, if $1,000 per day was enough for Paris. He'd heard that it "...was expensive" there. I laughed and told him I though they could have a great vacation on half that amount. Then I got to thinking about how much it could cost. Here's my estimate, based on how we spend money when we're in Paris:

[table th="0"]

Hotel[attr style="width:60px"], $300[attr style="width:60px"], Hotel des Deux Iles[attr style="width:100px"]

Breakfast,$32,At the hotel; expensive but worth it for us.

Lunch,$20-$25,"Sandwich and dessert from a boulangerie, or eat at a creperie."

Dinner,$100-$150,"Can get much higher! But this range will get you a very nice dinner in a nice restaurant, with a bottle of wine."

"Museums, visits, etc.",$25,"This amount will get two people into a museum. We <em>never </em>do more than one museum a day, so you might spend more. If we spent more that this, we'd be fried."

"Metro, busses, batobus, etc.", $25,"Might be more if you took taxis, but the metro is fast and the busses are fun."

"Bottle of wine for, er, refreshment and nourishment",$10-12,"Really, you can get very nice wines for this price. Want to splurge? Go all the way to $20. You won't believe the quality at that price compared to what you get for $20 in the U.S."

"<strong>Total</strong>",<strong>$512-569</strong>,"<strong>See, not bad!</strong>"

[/table]

I was a little off on my "half of a $1,000 per day" estimate, but not much, and I think with a slightly less expensive hotel, and staying at around $100 for dinner, you'd be there.

Now, you could spend a whole lot more (the<em> prix fixe</em> dinner at La Tour Argent is $260 for each person, not including wine, which probably starts in the $80/bottle range), and you could spend less. Hotel des Deux Iles is a small (17-room) hotel that we love dearly and has been our Paris "home"for almost 20 years; its location is unbeatable, on Ile St. Louis, but you can certainly find hotels for less. Careful, though; if you drop much below $200 per night, you are likely to be either a long way from the interesting parts of the city, or in a place that will disappoint. There are some excellent hotels in the $200-$250 range: Hotel des Deux Continents or Hotel de Seine, for example.

Our travel style tends toward the simple. Paris calls for walking, so we walk a lot. Our favorite thing is to walk along the Seine, especially at night. I think we do that every night we're there (helps that we stay on an island).

And of course, when you throw in airfare, the per day costs go right up. Summer 2014 airfares Seattle - Paris are in the $1,600 range, so add another $3,200 for airfare, spread out over ten days and now you're looking at $850-$900 per day, airfare included. All the more reason to stay longer: spreads out the airfare. In our case, we got tickets for $1,200 each (British Airways, before May 17) and we're staying 146 days, so our plane tickets add  only about $16 per day.

I think that a good minimum for us would be about $500 per day, which gets a nice hotel, meals in neighborhood restaurants (which will still be amazing), and no shopping sprees!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hard to believe, but after twenty years, Laurie retired last Monday. Tuesday she was pretty exhausted, both physically - from cleaning out her desk - and emotionally - from having everyone in the library, co-workers and patrons, come to say good-bye to her.</p>
<p>It will take her some getting used to it, certainly. We were talking about doing something and she said that we should wait until the weekend; I pointed out that, from now on, every day is a weekend day. "Oh…yeah…that's right…"</p>
<p>Tonight is the going-away party. Her colleagues decided to do it on a Friday off-site so they could have a real party, rather than treats in a library meeting room. Should be fun...no really, library parties can be fun. Honestly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're here, and so far, everything's gone just fine!<br /><br />The flights over passed the test for successful travel these days: they were uneventful. I know that's a rather low bar to success, but given the quality of air travel these days, it works. Both flights were on time, all our bags arrived with us; that's success!<br /><br />We did have one little last minute glitch: at noon on the day we left, we decided that maybe we should weigh the four suitcases, since there is a 23kg limit (51 pounds) for each. Surprise: three of the four were overweight by about ten pounds. We did some rapid re-packing and adjusting, and left a few things behind, and re-weighed. Looked good, so off we went. Official weights at the airport: 22.6kg, 22.4, 22.4, 22.2. Phew - a total of about 4 pounds on the light side. On the other hand, I don't think the woman checking us in even glanced at the weights, so maybe we would have gotten away without the re-packing panic.<br /><br />We stayed with Mary &amp; Gilles the first night and came to Montigny (pronounced "Monteenyee") the next day. The house we rented here is fine, but clearly showed signs that it's occupied only a few weeks a year. So the first day was clean and dust and clean some more and get the cobwebs down. Now, after a couple days, it's really starting to feel like home. The boulangerie a hundred yards down the street is - as judged by our friends here - an excellent one, and I am not going to argue that. I went this morning for croissants and didn't make a fool of myself. We'll be known there in a few days, for sure.<br /><br />Yesterday we got a phone. Mary had just bought a new phone and we got the old one. It's a decidedly non-smart phone, but perfect for our needs. We signed up for a pre-paid plan - through the post office - and get 3 hours of in-France phone calls for about $40. We can receive international calls, but not make them, which is just fine with us. <br /><br />And we'll have Internet in the house next week (or maybe the week after; after all, this is France). It'll be about $33 per month including a bunch of television channels. Until then, we get 15 channels, all in French, which does us little good! When Internet arrives, it'll be a whole lot easier to post and use email. <br /><br />And tomorrow we pick up our car, a Renault Clio4. It's a sporty little car and should get over 40 mpg on diesel. Diesel is cheaper that gasoline here, but I think it's still about $7 per gallon.<br /><br />France has had the coolest Spring ever recorded (and I'm not talking about "coolest" in the 'hip' sense, but temperature sense) and that's the way it's been since we arrived: cloudy and cool. We've gotten out for a few walks already, and ventured into the Fountainebleau forest this morning. Montigny borders the Fountainbleau forest, which was a preserve of French kings since Louis XIV in the 16th century and has been kept as a government-owned park. It has over 650 miles of marked paths and many more miles of informal ones. We're not going far into there without a map of the forest and our GPS! Otherwise, I can guarantee we'd get lost and probably never be seen again.<br /><br />So that's it for now. I think it is really sinking in that we're going to be here almost five more months. Guess I'd better call that woman we know about French lessons...<br /><br />A tout a l'heure!<br /><br />John<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Rue%20Georges%20Clemenceau,Chartrettes,France%4048.487054%2C2.702006&amp;z=10'>Rue Georges Clemenceau,Chartrettes,France</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laurie and I have always, on our travels, been drawn to water: rivers and canals in particular. So it's no surprise that today (May 19 - late post because of no Internet until today, May 29), the first sunny day we've had since we arrived, we would choose to walk along a canal that runs a mile or so south of here. The surprise was what we encountered there.</p>
<p>Canals criss-cross France; they are nearly all connected, so a canal boat can travel from the very north of France to the Mediterranean. Old canals are not wide, and the locks on them are built to a standard length and width specification which was once suitable for canal boats carrying goods. Today, though, for a canal boat to be profitable, it must be huge, and so they are limited to the larger rivers: near Chartrettes, where Mary and Gilles live, is a lock that is probably a quarter of a mile long and fifty yards wide. BIG boats use it, loaded heavily with rock and sand being taken to cement factories on the Seine north of Paris.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the old canals are left to pleasure boats: the canal-boat tours that are so popular, and private vessels, often converted from older, no-longer-profitable working boats. The canals are maintained beautifully and, for us, offer beautiful and peaceful walks. And for some reason, Laurie and I always enjoy watching boats go through the locks on canal or river.</p>
<p>This morning we walked along the Loing Canal, which parallels the Loing River (remember, we're living in Montigny-sur-Loing: "Montigny on the Loing". We reached a lock and while we were there, a car roared down the road to the lock, a man (wearing a tee-shirt, shorts and sandals, despite the cold breeze that blew) jumped out and set the lock to be ready for a boat coming upstream. Then he jumped in his car and roared off. We started to walk farther down the canal and saw that a boat was, indeed, coming upstream. So we walked back to the lock - l'ecluse - and waited. The boat eased into the lock as the lock-keeper returned. This was a tour-boat. We talked to the captain, who told us that he had 20 people on-board, that it was a bicycle tour, that everyone was off on their bikes and that he was going meet them in Nemours, 6 miles distant; he would arrive there in about 3 hours. Speed is not a factor on these canals.</p>
<p>The boat locked-through, and another boat arrived from upstream. This was a smaller, private vessel. It came into the locks, tied up and the owner stepped off and greeted us in poorly-pronounced French. Laurie commented on the sunshine, and the owner laughed and started speaking to us in English. Soon his wife joined us, finished with her duty of tying the front of the boat to the lock. They said that the lock-keeper had told them, at the last lock, that he would not be able to lock them through until after his lunch, which ended at 1 o'clock. So they were stuck for an hour.</p>
<p>We chatted with them for a while. They were from Ireland, and had been boating through France for four years; well, the parts of four years that the canals are open; it turns out that the canals close from October to March. Soon, Michael (we'd introduced ourselves by then; his wife was Rosemary) asked if we'd like to have a glass of wine with them. So onto the boat we went, and Michael opened a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p>The conversation flowed and Rosemary asked if we could stay for lunch! Out came more wine, a beautiful salad she'd made, paté, sliced ham (a French staple), anchovies and cheese. We sat at a table on the back of the boat and had a wonderful meal with them. In fact, the lock-keeper returned and Michael asked him if he could delay locking them through for half an hour.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="IMG_4463.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_44631.jpg" alt="IMG 4463" width="600" height="400" border="0" /></p>
<p>I think we could have stayed all afternoon, but when the half-hour was up, the lock-keeper started making impatient noises and then another boat arrived. We took a hurried tour of their boat (the Mabel-Rose) and by the time we jumped off, the boat was half-way down in the lock; another minute and we would have needed a ladder to get off. If we'd known the next lock to be not too far away, we would have stayed on board and floated down the Loing Canal with Rosemary and Michael and gotten off there to walk back. But we didn't know how far we would have to walk (turned out to be about three miles), so we waved to Rosemary and Michaels as they disappeared around a bend in the canal.</p>
<p>We love serendipitous adventures like this. We have learned that being friendly and curious brings us experiences like this.We gave Rosemary and Michael our email addresses (the boat is fully connected to the 'net) and I suspect we'll be in touch, and we hope we can connect with them as we and they see France. They were delightful; it feels as if meeting them really started our French adventure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A word or two about Cleo, our Renault Clio4. This is a nice little car and, like its Citroen and Peugeot siblings, puts paid to the reputation that French cars deservedly earned in the United States in the 1960s. Who can forget the Renault Dauphine, or the Citroen DS-19 or any of a short line of Peugeots, cars of dubious reliability, design, comfort and appearance? Those days are gone.</p>
<p><br />This Clio4, a new Clio model, is a bit smaller than our Prius, to give you an idea of its size. Back seat legroom is not its strong point, but it has a much bigger trunk than the Prius. It's well-built, looks great, has a lot of pep, handles like a sports car and - here's the clincher - is getting 49 mpg average for the first couple hundred miles (or, as the French measure mileage: 4.8 litres/100 km). That is better mileage than we get with our Prius, and I can guarantee you that Cleo is a whole lot peppier and fun to drive.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="IMG_4485.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_44851.jpg" alt="IMG 4485" width="600" height="400" border="0" />Here's the Clio4/Prius summary: the Prius has more rear legroom. The Clio4 has more luggage space, more pep, and better mileage. I don't think you can touch a Prius in the United States for less than $22- or $23k; a baseline Clio4 (which is what we have, except we added GPS) is about $18,000. Makes me think Renault could succeed in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll tell you a bit about our "home" in France, Montigny sur Loing. We're about an hour south of Paris, by train or car (but who in their right mind would drive in Paris?). The town is about 2,800 people, though the daily population is some less than that, as many houses seem to be weekend homes and are closed up during the week.

Montigny has two restaurants, open only for lunch, two small general stores, and a boulangerie that our French friends pronounce to be far above average. My French has progressed to having an excellent grasp of all I need in the boulangerie, so my daily morning task is to walk down the street to the boulangerie and order a couple baguettes and a loaf of bread each morning.

The houses in Montigny range from "old French" to new and quite modern to very nice. Here are some pictures of houses in the town; see if you can guess which is <em>chez Zumsteg:</em>

</table>

This place is unbelievably quiet! At night there is simply no noise! (For the audiophiles among readers, our bedroom is 35db at night, with the window open.)

We've walked all over Montigny. It's just what we wanted: a small, old, quite pretty French village. Wouldn't mind a restaurant, though...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Note: this was Saturday, May 19 - little late posting this because of the delay in getting connected.

We tried to walk around today, really we did. But though the temperature wasn't too bad - somewhere around 55 - the 30 mph wind and rain did us in. So we just took a drive through the country-side and visited a couple small towns. We ended in the town of Larchant, which rewarded us with a most unusual church to visit.

I think most Americans, when they think about France, think,"Paris, big city." Paris is, indeed, a big city and there are other big cities in France, but much of France is beautifully rural. Our drive today took us through miles and miles of farmlands, and a number of villages. The views were just beautiful: many fields are planted in rape-seed - grown for its oil - which are now in bloom. These fields are a brilliant yellow. Many fields are a deep green (don't know what's planted there), and others are fallow: plowed but not planted. So the vistas are miles and miles of bright yellow, deep green and dark brown fields, interspersed with small copses of trees.

France is a country of villages. I'd guess that if I drew a circle on the map 15 miles across and centered on Montigny, that circle would capture more than 150 villages with less than 1,500 people in each. These villages have existed forever and, if they now have traffic signs and cars, mostly they look as they have for hundreds of years.

In our drive, I saw a sign pointing to Larchant. We have an excellent book on France titled the "France - A Phaidon Cultural Guide" which details every small cultural detail of the slightest interest throughout France. I had read the entry for Larchant, as it is not too far from us, and remembered that it's thought that a Saint Mathurin was born there in the third century. Whether he was born there or not, in the Middle Ages a church was built on top of his funerary chapel and became a pilgrimage destination. As Laurie and I are fascinated with pilgrimages (not that we've ever been on one), I pointed the car toward Larchant.

The Phaidon guide said about the church in Larchant that the tower had fallen down in the 17th century (right - more or less four hundred years ago). It didn't mention that the entire church had pretty much fallen into ruins and that, in 1983, a twenty-year effort to restore it began. (Phaidon was published in 1975, before the restoration started.) Much of the church, including the tower, was too far gone to restore, but about a third of the nave, the transept and the choir have all been restored (less part of the roof, which has a wood ceiling now where once it was stone). This church was really big for such a small town (the power of a pilgrimage), and the restored part is, simply stated, beautiful. As much as possible, original materials were recovered from the rubble of the ruins and used, and where that was not possible, stone matching the original stone was quarried and worked as a thousand years ago. Stained glass windows, long gone, were restored with modern stained glass, in modern patterns.

I have no idea how much it cost to restore the Iglise Saint-Mathurin, but I am glad it was done. The church is light and beautiful and gives a sense of how it must have been when a pilgrim arrived after walking hundreds of miles.

By the way, Saint Mathurin is said to have been a healer of madness. We offered up a few prayers for folks we know dealing with that dark problem. Who knows? Maybe Saint Mathurin still has a bit of power to help. And given the rain here, we may need some of that help ourselves soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weather has been, simply said, awful. Europe is suffering through the coolest and wettest Spring in the last 25 years. Last Friday was the coldest May 24th ever recorded in Paris, and they started recording temperatures in the mid-1800s. In the two weeks we've been here, we have had one beautifully sunny (if cool: about 62 degrees F), two sunny mornings, and the rest rain.</p>
<p>This is an advantage of an extended stay. Yeah the weather's lousy, but we can shrug and say that it will, sooner or later, improve. If I had planned and paid for a two-week stay in France in May, I would have been an unhappy camper. Any two week vacation in Paris in May this year would have netted you two or three days of non-rainy weather. </p>
<p>Even in the bad weather, we've been out every day, driving around the beautiful countryside, seeing small villages, walking when we can. We figure that, no matter how much we worry about the weather, our worrying and fretting and complaining doesn't change the flight of one single drop of rain, so why do it? We say, "Well, it's lousy weather, but if we have to be in lousy weather, it's nice to be in lousy weather in France."</p>
<p>Next week the forecast calls for improvement: partly cloudy, no rain, temps into the high-60s and low-70s, starting Saturday. We're planning our first foray into Paris Saturday; we have just not wanted to do that until we had some assurance that we wouldn't be slogging around in a downpour.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Actually, Internet access <em>chez Zumsteg</em> came only five days late. It was the process:

- When Gilles first arranged with SFR (the provider), access was going to start May 24.

- Then I got a text saying I would have access sometime between May 24 and May 27.

- Then I got a letter saying my Internet access would start sometime in the next three weeks.

-Then I got a text saying that it would start sometime between 5/26 and 5/29.

- Then I got a text saying that they had to delay my access, they were working on it, and I could follow their progress on a website. Of course, I needed access to get to the website that would show their progress on getting me access...

- Gilles checked the website the very next morning, and it showed that the connection had been activated. I fussed around a bit with the router here at the house, and, sure enough, it worked.

Access here is via the phone lines, so it's not so fast as my access at home (in fact, it's about one-quarter as fast), but it's plenty fast for what I need here; I'm not going to be streaming any movies. And it includes a bunch of TV channels, and a land-line that has unlimited international calling. Cost is about $45 per month. So, all in all, a pretty good deal. Finally.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We didn't do anything special today; just took a drive in the country. Here are some pictures from our drive.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Canal du Loing-1.jpg" alt="Canal du Loing 1" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Canal-du-Loing-1.jpg" width="384" height="576" border="0" />

This is the Canal du Loing, near us. Any questions about why we like to walk along the canals?

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Chateau in the fields.jpg" alt="Chateau in the fields" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Chateau-in-the-fields.jpg" width="600" height="400" border="0" />

We came across this Renaissance chateau out in the middle of nowhere.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Field with rapeseed.jpg" alt="Field with rapeseed" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Field-with-rapeseed1.jpg" width="600" height="400" border="0" />

Beautiful, eh? The bright yellow field is rape-seed, grown widely in France for its oil. The countryside around us looks like this for miles and miles. We can get in the car and just drive and drive on the narrowest roads we can find, and enjoy it thoroughly.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Church in Nonville.jpg" alt="Church in Nonville" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Church-in-Nonville.jpg" width="384" height="576" border="0" />

Most towns have their own, very old, Church. This is in Nonville (note: that translates as "No town." Why would anyone name a town "No Town?"). The plaque over the door has the name of the Church and the year of its first construction: 1623.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Church in Theurzy.jpg" alt="Church in Theurzy" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Church-in-Theurzy.jpg" width="600" height="400" border="0" />

The Church in Treuzy. No date on this Church, but some definite Romanesque features, which puts it in the 11th or 12th centuries. It's probably been rebuilt several times since then, but to the original design, so the Romanesque remains.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, it didn't take long to fall to this level: we bought wine in a box.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Box Wine.jpg" alt="Box Wine" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Box-Wine.jpg" width="427" height="576" border="0" class="alignright" />

Now, admittedly, we did buy Wine in a Box because our friend Gilles recommended it. But still...

As in almost every wine-producing region in the world, the French are experiencing a glut of wine. More producers, more regions, higher production have led to a flood of wine. (Except for the 2012 harvest, which was damaged by disease and weather.)  Domestic consumption of wine in France has declined some 20% over the last 20 years, yet France still produces some 7 billion(!!) bottles of wine.

What's happened is that wineries are producing good wine and selling it at lower cost than they would have before. So, the local supermarket, Carrefour, has a shelf of probably twenty different Wines in a Box, almost all from well-known regions. Cotes de Rhone in a Box? Got it. Burgundy in a Box? Yep. Corbieres in a Box? Right here. And, Bordeaux - the King of French wines - in a Box? Several different kinds.

The Bordeaux in a Box you see in the picture is a premium quality. It cost 15 Euro for a 3-liter box. That calculates to about $5 per bottle. Most of the other Wines in a Box are in the 10 Euro - 12 Euro range: about $4 per bottle.

So when Gilles recommended this wine, we had to give it a try. Our review: darn good wine, especially for the price. No wine experts are we, but I'd guess that a similar quality Bordeaux in the States would be in the $14-$16 per bottle range - about triple what we paid.

And no, we didn't see any White Zindfandel in a Box here. Actually, I think the French authorities arrest anyone trying to order White Zinfandel.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday we went into Paris for the first time this trip. We delayed that foray because the weather has been so bad (it's official: the worst May since the 1880's) but yesterday started what is forecast to be a ten-day streak of good weather, so off we went with our friends Mary &amp; Gilles.

When we stepped out of the train station, I stopped, looked around and got a big grin on my face. Laurie and I looked at each other and agreed: we felt as if we were home. We <em>love </em>this city, and as we've been here many times, so we're quite comfortable making our way around the city. It was so nice to be back.

Paris is a city that rewards looking up; the buildings are (almost) all beautiful. In the 1870s, Baron Von Haussman, at the direction of Napolean III (nephew <em>and </em>step-grandson of the real Napolean; don't ask) rebuilt Paris. He tore down many buildings and created the wide boulevards for which Paris is known. He also decreed that when new buildings went up, they had to be five stories high and of a certain architectural style. Where separate buildings were constructed on a block, the separate buildings had to have an architectural coherence, so that they looked good together, and the blocks looked good as a whole.

Now it's a beautifully planted walk above the city. This offers an unusual view of Paris, as the Promenade is about 30 feet above ground level for much of its route, so you're always looking down on streets and buildings. This was a railroad track to Bastille until the 1960s, and was converted to a promenade in the 70's."</td>

To understand it, you'll need a tiny bit of French history. In its late stages , the French Revolution went through a pretty horrific time, known as the Terror. During this time, even the faintest suspicion of non-Revolutionary zeal - in fact, simply the accusation, true or false, of not being fully committed to the Revolution - was sufficient for a person to be tried, convicted and sent to the guillotine. Thousands were executed in Paris. In the last month of the Terror, over 1,300 people were executed in nearby Place Nation, and buried in two common graves at a convent, now the Cimetiere Picpus. Afterwards, for a reason lost to history, the only people who could be buried there were those who had ancestors who had died in the Terror.As a result, the Picpus cemetery is full of the most aristocratic names in French history. One of these is well-known to Americans: Lafayette, who came to America to fight on General Washington's side in the American revolution. Lafayette was a hero to Americans, and to the French people for his roles in both the American Revolution and the French Revolution. He is buried in the Picpus cemetery, under soil from Bunker Hill (Boston, the first real battle of the American Revolution); his grave, and an American flag, are maintained by the Paris chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.</td>

Below, the plaque to the victims of the Terror, buried in the common graves. Note the sixteen Carmelite nuns, whose actions have become famous. Each nun, as she approached the guillotine, turned to the Mother Superior and said, "Permission to die?" When given permission, the nun then sang a hymn until the blade fell. Several movies and an opera have been made about them.

That, along with lots of walking (you <em>must </em>walk Paris to really see it), was our first day "home."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have completed our first three weeks here and can say that this may have been the most stressful first weeks of the five "long-stay" vacations here. Now these stresses have been offset by our French family having us for a cocktail hour and three dinners, but you may find a recounting of the challenges, um, humorous...
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Insurance Woes</h2>
First, the day after we arrived, I got an email from our insurance company that our auto insurance was overdue. Since I had everything on autopay, I was mystified. Fortunately, Mary and Gilles Internet plan includes being able to call landlines in foreign countries for no cost, so I gave 'em a call. The Customer Service Agent couldn't figure out why auto insurance had gone off auto-pay (homeowners was fine), but I gave her a credit card number, told her I'd figure out the auto-pay when we returned and all was good.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Bank Woes</h2>
Second challenge: the day we went to Sancerre, I returned to an email that our the bank&nbsp; that issues our credit card of choice ("The Bank" from here on; name available on request) had detected a possible fraudulent transaction and would I verify it. I looked and it was nothing I recognized - a charge from "AUDIOLOGY" for - wait for it - 66¢. The scam is that someone gets your credit card number, runs a small transaction like this to see if it works and then if it goes through, charges some serious transactions. So ya gotta say it was fraudulent. I did so, and the fun began.

Immediately, I got an email from The Bank saying that the card had been cancelled and the replacement would be sent <em>to my home address.&nbsp;</em>We are now without our preferred credit card, and though we have multiple backups (I think we have four other credit or debit cards with us), we really want to have and use that preferred one. Well, I think, I'll just call The Bank and ask them to send a card here, which requires them to cancel that new card and send another new card to us in France. Easy, right? Simple, right? Hah!

I called. I explained the situation and the Customer Service Agent said, "First we have to verify your identity, so I'll send a six-digit code to the cellphone number we have in your profile. Ummm, problem: that's my US cellphone number and it's not available to me while I'm here because I've put French SIMs in our phones. And she can send the code only to the number in my profile.

But The Bank woman can send the code via the email on my profile. Great, do it. Doesn't arrive, doesn't arrive, doesn't arrive. She gave up, I gave up and said I'll call the next day and try again. (The email with the code arrived six hours later.) I will admit that I was a little wound up.

I then tried to get to my account on The Bank's website, thinking I can change the phone number to which the authentication code will be sent. Using my username and password I got through part of the login process. The site then emails me a six-digit code which actually arrives in a few seconds. I continue the login process and find I have to enter the last five digits and the three-digit security code of the replacement card. I did not, of course, have them because the freaking card was on its way to Seattle.

A call the next day was about the same. For The Bank to verify my identify so they can&nbsp; even think about doing anything, I had to have the replacement card number and security code. The situation now was a classic catch-22:&nbsp; I needed the new card number and security code to get the new card number and security code.

I politely told The Bank lady I was pretty angry about this. The Bank had made it impossible for me to use their credit card and is doing absolutely nothing to help me. She agreed, but said there was nothing she could do.

Our Seattle mail is being forwarded to a friend, so we decided to wait until the cards were forwarded to her, have her send them to us and go from there. A couple days later I saw (via the post office's Informed Delivery, which sends me an image of first-class mail that has arrived for me) that the cards had arrived. Great, they'll be forwarded and we'll proceed. Not great; two weeks later they had not arrived at the forwarding address.

Another call to The Bank (I thought all these calls were to a toll-free international number; they were not. Another battle I'll fight with The Bank to see if I can get those charges back). The first woman I talked to heard my tale of woe, told me that The Bank does not allow forwarding so the card was returned to the bank, did a bit of research and transferred me to the nicest woman in the whole entire world, who listened to my tale of woe (and apologized profusely at the lack of help I'd gotten). At the end of my tale I simply said, "I want The Bank to send me replacement cards here in France." Her response, "Certainly. I can do that." And she did. I talked to her Monday morning and Wednesday afternoon replacement cards arrived here in Bois-le-Roi. Activated them and we are - finally - good to go again.

And just to make things more amusing, the day after we received our replacement cards here in France, those original replacement cards - that went to our home address but were supposed to be returned to Bank as un-forwardable - showed up at the forwarding address. Who knows where they spent the last two and a half weeks.&nbsp;

Lessons learned if you're a long way from home and get that "fraudulent transaction" message from your bank or credit union:

First, if you get that "fraudulent transaction" message while away from your home address, call the bank rather than just clicking on the "Yes, it was fraudulent" button. Then you can arrange something to get the new card mailed to you before the old is cancelled. If you just click, you may have no way to get the card sent anywhere except your profile address.

Second, make sure you're actually calling on a toll-free number! I've got 44 minutes of international calls that I likely will have to eat. I could have made those calls on Mary and Gilles landline at no cost if I'd realized I wasn't on a toll-free number (it was a collect-call number, but as I was dialing direct, that meant I was just dialing a U.S. number. A further note, after some research, making a collect call with a cellphone appears to be flat-out impossible).

Third, if you have two-factor authentication on an account, remember that it's quite possible that you will not be able to get SMS texts overseas. If that's the only way you've got TFA set up, you're in trouble.

Fourth, have a reasonable amount of alcohol close by. Several bottles of wine might b enough. Might. Each time you call.

I am glad that The Bank has the capability to identify and stop fraudulent transactions. But dang, they need a better way to deal with a situation like this, where I needed a card sent to me outside the United States. The Bank could handle this situation in a simple easy way, but three of the four customer service agents I talked to did not know that it could be done (one suggested I go to a local The Bank branch office). I'm nominating that last woman for Customer Service Agent of the century.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As y'all know, I love taking pictures. I try to use the best and most interesting for the blog, but they represent maybe 5% or 10% of all the photos I take. The rest are for Laurie and me to look at through the winter and remember special times and places. Sometimes I get asked what kind of camera I use, so here's a post to reveal my secrets.

Whenever we're out at popular tourist sites, I see folks hauling around huge DSLR cameras, with a big bag full of lenses and equipment. Look at the camera below: do you know how heavy this is, not counting the additional lenses in the bag? No, thanks.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7211" rel="attachment wp-att-7211"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7211" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dslr.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="235"></a>I thought some folks might like to see my camera:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7214" rel="attachment wp-att-7214"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7214" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_4650-2.jpg" alt="" width="864" height="648"></a>This is a Sony RX100M3. I got it not long before the trip to replace my older Sony RX100M2, which went into a lake with me when a canoe I was in capsized. &nbsp;I looked at other more sophisticated cameras but decided to go with what I knew. No bag required: I carry this in a small case on my belt.

This is a pretty top-of-the-line point-and-shoot camera; in terms of picture resolution it holds its own against dang good SLRs. Later versions of this camera have a much longer telephoto capability, but they trade off something I value and use a lot: at the wide-angle end of the lens' range the camera has a 28mm capability and a 1.8 f-stop. That means I can take pictures in very low light; the cameras with lots of telephoto capability do not have the ability to take low-light pictures without a flash. And before I bought my first RX100 five years ago I tracked how often I used a long lens and it wasn't very often, so I don't miss that capability.

This camera also has an easy-to-use manual capability, meaning I can set the shutter speed and f-stop to suit unusual situations. I don't need that often, but it's invaluable when I run into some odd light situation.

This camera has a ton of bells and whistles; certainly all that I ever need. When I see someone carting around $5,000 worth of camera and lenses in a big bag slung over their shoulder, I'm reminded that the great photographers of the earlier days - Ansel Adams, Georgia O'Keefe, Edward Weston, Alfred Stieglitz, Annie Leibovitz, Diane Arbus - used what were essentially glorified box cameras, with not the first automatic feature. It isn't the equipment that makes good photos, it's the photographer.&nbsp;

As for "post-processing" (messing around with a picture in the computer to make it look better), I use Adobe's Lightroom. I'm a bit of a traditionalist about this: I don't do anything I couldn't do in a well-equipped darkroom. I crop the picture if necessary, adjust the exposure and contrast, clean up perspective on buildings - all things I could do in a dark room.&nbsp;

See? No secrets. I think we can take really good pictures without spending a fortune on equipment. If there is a secret to taking good pictures, it's "Love the picture you're taking." I try to take a picture only if I love what I'm seeing and want others to love it, too, through the picture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easy day today, so I'll just make a few comments and post some pictures.</p>
<p>First accomplishment was to find a <em>bricolage</em> (hardware store) and buy a toilet seat, as the one in the main bathroom had broken. Found the store not too far away, found the plumbing section, found the toilet seats, found...Gasp! $55 for the cheapest decent one. Mary had warned us, but that still surprised us!</p>
<p>Then we walked in Saint-Mammès (pronounced "San mammae", accent on the last syllable). Laurie and I have always really liked the paintings of the Impressionist Alfred Sisley, so we were pleased to learn (at the houseboat recital) that Sisley had lived and painted here. We knew he lived for some years in the neighboring town of Moret-sur-Loing and planned to spend some time there, but today we came back to Saint-Mammès because the town has a Sisley walk, showing the locations of some of his paintings. Here's an example:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Sisly-1.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sisly-1.jpg" alt="Sisly 1" width="250" height="184" border="0" />A poor picture of a Sisley painting.</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Sisly-2.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sisly-2.jpg" alt="Sisly 2" width="250" height="166" border="0" />Walk into the courtyard of a building on the main street of Saint-Mammès, turn around, and here's what you see.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Saint-Mammès is a beautiful village, where the Loing River and Canal du Loing enter the Seine. As a result, it has for many years been a gathering place for the working boats on the Seine. </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img class="centeralign" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="boats.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/boats1.jpg" alt="Boats" width="500" height="333" border="0" />Boats on the Seine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="saint-mammes-2.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/saint-mammes-2.jpg" alt="Saint mammes 2" width="500" height="333" border="0" />Rue du Seine in Saint-Mammès, which looks out on the Seine River.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Later we walked along another section of Canal du Loing, as it enters Saint-Mammès. We watched a boat lock through, and found a plaque pointing out that Sisley had painted this very lock.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="sisley-3.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sisley-3.jpg" alt="Sisley 3" width="250" height="174" border="0" /></p>
<p>Again, a poor reproduction of Sisley's picture.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="sisley-lock.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sisley-lock.jpg" alt="Sisley lock" width="250" height="163" border="0" /></p>
<p>And the very same lock, today.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Later we walked along a part of the Canal du Loing and came to this lock. With views like this, any questions as to why we enjoy walking on the canal? </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="lock-1.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/lock-11.jpg" alt="Lock 1" width="600" height="400" border="0" /></p>
<p>Weather has turned great - sunny and comfortably warm. We're planning a trip to Paris later this week. Can't wait!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Really. Sunday, we were invited to a piano and voice recital on a houseboat in the beautiful small town of Saint-Mammès. Here's a picture of the boat, from across the river:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="boat.jpg" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/boat.jpg" alt="Boat" width="500" height="247" border="0" /></p>
<p>The recital was piano and songs from the Belle Epoque (Beautiful Age), which is generally considered to be from around 1870 to the start of World War 1. The music was excellent and the setting unique. Only problem was that when we felt moved, we weren't sure whether is was by the music or the wake of a passing boat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

By the way, it's challenging to keep up the pace without our longer-legged companion along. Hope both good weather systems (here and there) stick around for a while!! Your yard is growing like a jungle!!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Carol,

Good to hear from you! We are eating rhubarb tonight from Mary's garden--she taught me to serve it over a rich yogurt, with gingersnap cookies crumbled into the yogurt and the stewed rhubarb on top, with warm honey on top of that!

I've looked through the recipes I brought and I can't find your rhubarb meringue torte--would you be good enough to send that to me please? I know that Mary and Gilles would love it.

I'll post a kitchen blog sometime--it's  been kind of a kick cooking here.

Let me know if Joanne Flagel had a good time in Paris--I think they were here for the dreadful weather, unfortunately.

I need to do yoga again soon or I will have forgotten my whole routine! Please say hi to everyone at yoga for me.

Laurie]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we finally made it to Moret sur Loing. We thought we'd get there the last couple days, but got sidetracked in Saint-Mammès. We were interested in Moret-sur-Loing for a couple reasons: the Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley lived here for quite a few years (he died here), and it's the largest town around, with almost 5,000 inhabitants. </p>
<p>It didn't take long to see why Sisley painted here; the Loing River flows right through the time and it is just beautiful. The town has really made use of the river, with lots of views onto it and walks and a bridge into town. It seems to me that a painter here would have no problem finding things to paint. I read that Sisley painted some 500 pictures in this area; he could easily done 500 more. Some photos of the riverfront:</p>
<table><tr><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Riverside-1.jpg" alt="Riverside 1" title="Riverside-1.jpg" border="0" width="275" height="183" /></td><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Riverside-5.jpg" alt="Riverside 5" title="Riverside-5.jpg" border="0" width="265" height="183" /></td></tr></table>
There are a number of places posted where Sisley painted a picture, so that a visitor can see the painting and look at the view today. That is a pretty amazing thing to do:
<table><tr><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sisly-1-sign.jpg" alt="Sisly 1 sign" title="Sisly-1-sign.jpg" border="0" width="275" height="195" /></td><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sisly-1-photo1.jpg" alt="Sisly 1 photo" title="Sisly-1-photo.jpg" border="0" width="275" height="183" /></td></tr></table>Sisley painted this about 100 yards to the left, but you can still see the tower and church. As I mentioned a couple days ago, Laurie and I have long been fans of Alfred Sisley, so living near where he lived and being able to see the places he painted is a treat for us.
<br>Some miscellaneous pictures from Moret:
<table><tr><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Laurie-in-river.jpg" alt="Laurie in river" title="Laurie in river.jpg" border="0" width="275" height="183" />Laurie and the Loing River</td><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Riverside-2.jpg" alt="Riverside 2" title="Riverside-2.jpg" border="0" width="275" height="183" />Mostly, I love the willow tree.</td></tr><tr><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Riverside-32.jpg" alt="Riverside 3" title="Riverside-3.jpg" border="0" width="125" height="187" />I could live here…</td><td><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Lawn-1.jpg" alt="Lawn 1" title="Lawn-1.jpg" border="0" width="275" height="183" />We weren't the only ones enjoying the river.</td></tr></table>
<p>Another bit of Moret history: when Napolean returned from his first exile on Elba, he spent a night in Moret on his march to Paris. I did not, though, see any "Napolean slept here" signs.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We made a trip into Paris today and although there were a couple minor problems, it was great to be back in our favorite city.

Here's a reason I love this city:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ile de la Cite-1.jpg" alt="Ile de la Cite 1" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ile-de-la-Cite-1.jpg" width="600" height="337" border="0" />

Ya know, there just aren't many views like that in the world. On the left, that's the back of Notre Dame, and on the right a block of buildings. All of Ile de la Cité had buildings like that before Haussman, in his effort to "modernize" Paris, tore them down. Now, about a tenth of the island has the old buildings. Ile de la Cité once had 14 churches besides Notre Dame; now it has only Notre Dame and Sainte. Chapelle.

The first…er…difficulty was that when we got to Gare de Lyon, we went to the stop for the most direct metro (subway) into the heart of Paris. We got on a completely stuffed metro car, waited, waited, waited and then the doors closed, and we waited some more. And waited even more. It's hot, it's completely jammed (Laurie said she could feel people breathing down her neck) and claustrophobia is starting its work. After ten or twelve minutes of that fun the doors opened. We got off and when it became clear that the No. 1 Metro line was not working too well, I plotted an alternative route. Because Gare de Lyon is a big entry point into Paris, four Metro lines converge there, and a person should be able to transfer from one line to another without needing a ticket. So we followed the signs to the No 14 Metro, got to a place that had a turnstile to go out, and our tickets would not get us out. Stuck in the Metro! Shades of Charlie on the MTA.

Finally we just followed another person out the turnstile (I might point out that we were not the only people doing that), went to the No. 14 line and, of course, our tickets would not get us through the turnstiles to that line, either. So we bought some metro tickets, got in the No. 14 and, 45 minutes after we arrived in Paris, we were at Ile de la Cité - a trip that should have taken ten minutes. Who knows what went wrong?

We took a stroll we've taken many times before, just getting back into a Paris frame of mind. We walked down the north side of Ile de la Cité, watched several river boats go by, walked around Ile St. Louis, and had lunch at a Salon de Thé that we've eaten at for almost twenty years. We had the same old thing: a smoked salmon and havarti cheese crepe, a chocolate and almond crepe and a half litre of rosé wine. Ah….back in Paris.

Then we walked up to Luxembourg gardens, but the second difficulty was starting to make its effects felt: it was hot - over 80 and pretty humid. I'm okay with that; Laurie is not. So we slowed down to conserve energy. We stopped in at one of our favorite churches here, St. Severin and lucked into an organ recital. Almost no one there, cool, and very peaceful.
<img class="alignleft" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="St Severin-1.jpg" alt="St Severin 1" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/St-Severin-11.jpg" width="175" height="311" border="0" />
St. Severin is one of the oldest churches in Paris, originally built in the eleventh century, and I like it a lot. It's small, has a unique architecture based on many additions and changes over the years, and has always been a church of students (it's in the same <em>quartier</em> as the Sorbonne and other Paris universities).

The Luxembourg Gardens were also crammed, and this isn't a place I expect many tourists to visit. I guess sunny weather after a terrible Winter and Spring caused Spring Fever to infect so many people.

By now, we were dragging, so we decided to head for Gare de Lyon and home. I looked up a bus that would get us to the Gare and down the road we went. Unfortunately, the map I had didn't show the exact route, so I didn't realize that the bus going <em>to</em> Gare de Lyon went on a different street that the bus coming <em>from </em>Gare de Lyon. Couldn't figure out why buses were going one way and not the other. Finally, I gave up, we walked down a block and - voila - there's a bus station for our bus and, even better, a bus arriving in about five minutes.

We got to the Gare at about 4, knowing that trains that stop in Montigny-sur-Loing leave at 19 minutes past every hour. We saunter in and I see on the <em>Departée</em> board that the next train that stops in Montigny will leave in eight minutes. We run to it, climb aboard, find two seats together and away we go. Turns out that the trains that stop at Montigny leave at 19 minutes after the hour every hour <em>except </em>four and five in the afternoon; those leave at nine minutes after the hour. Phew! Glad we were there a little early.

But the train was slow and late arriving and by the time we got home, we were ready for more than one glass of rosé, which we did indeed have. Laurie put a fish poacher pan that's in the rental house to a new and excellent use: she soaked her tired feet in it. No fish for us for a while...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today the weather turned sour again - we had a huge lightning-thunderstorm last night and woke up to clouds and cool temps and likely rain. So we decided to drive to the town of Chateau-Landon.

We learned of Chateau-Landon when we saw it described as a stop on a canal boat trip. It is an ancient town, with what sounded to be lots of interesting sites. So off we went. Chateau-Landon did not disappoint; it's a beautiful town set on a hillside, with some interesting things to see, not all of which we saw. We'll be back to explore Chateau-Landon more thoroughly.
<h2>The Church</h2>
The church in Chateau-Landon ranks among the most interesting we've seen. Churches reflect the development and history of the towns they serve. We find them interesting for that reason; they are always unique, like their towns, and always interesting. Here are three views of this most unusual church:
[gallery link="file" ids="361,359, 360"]
Now, I suspected that both faithful readers of this blog are scratching their heads and saying, "He thinks that's interesting?" So let me explain a bit.

This Church was built on a much older church, as is common here. The picture on the left is from the earliest remaining part of the building; it was constructed in the 11th century, so that wall, and the aisle behind it, is Romanesque in style. There are few signs of Romanesque in France, as most churches from that time were later rebuilt in Gothic or Renaissance styles (or in some cases, it appears, no style at all).

The central nave is from the 13th century, so it's Gothic: note the vaulting and pointed arches. Okay, that's not all that interesting, I guess.

The North Aisle is unusual in several ways. It was built in the 14th century, so it's pure Gothic, too, but this aisle is as wide as the nave. In fact, there is an altar at the front of this aisle, so this Church really is, from left to right facing the front, Romanesque aisle, Gothic nave, and what's really a second late-Gothic nave. It turns out that when the north aisle was constructed, they decided to use all the land they had at the side of the Church. This "aisle" is wide and oddly-shaped, as it follows the line of the road outside.

Anyway, for us, an interesting Church.

And of course, every church needs a bar-brasserie (<em>d'eglise</em> translates as "of the church"): <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Bar-church.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-358" alt="Bar-church" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Bar-church.jpg" width="288" height="432" /></a>
<h2>Abbay of St. Severin</h2>
This is a picture of the 12th century abbay of St. Severin. Today it is...a retirement home. Really. A beautiful retirement home at that (you can't see the residential areas, but they're in beautifully-restored abbay buildings). Laurie and I applied to live there.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Retirement-home.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362" alt="Retirement home" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Retirement-home.jpg" width="288" height="432" /></a>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
We did get some exercise:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stairs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-363" alt="Stairs" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stairs.jpg" width="288" height="432" /></a>

Laurie says it was 80 steps; I was panting too hard to count. Someday they'll be more about Chateau-Landon, as there evidently are more things to see. We liked this place a lot.
<h3>Make Way for Ducklings</h3>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Laurie and John,
I've enjoyed reading your blogs and just saw your question to Carol about our trip. Yes, the weather was a bit cold while we were there, but it did not slow us down much.  Bernards were very generous with us, got us off to a good start with the Metro, took us to Vaux le Vicomte, and home for dinner.  We had that first week-end to explore on our own and enjoyed a Sunday at the Luxemburg Gardens without  crowds. We saw a lot with our tour, appreciated our hotel, and were only drenched once.  The last week-end, we aborted our plans for Giverney and enjoyed chatting with the daughter of my cousin who teaches in Paris.  She is from N. Ireland and was very interested in family and life in the US.   All in all, we had a very good trip and appreciate you thinking of us!  Tomorrow is book club and I will miss you, especially.
Joanne]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title><![CDATA[Une Deviation...]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Driving in France, the sign I dread most is "Deviation." A deviation is a detour, and seeing a Deviation means that you're going to go off the main road, often into narrow streets; your GPS will be confused, your maps of no value, your fine pre-planned route out the window. In other words, an unwanted adventure is sure to follow.

We ran into a vacation deviation two days ago - not on a road, but in the kitchen. After dinner I was cleaning up and Laurie mentioned that it would be nice if we could put the coffee press into the dish-washer, but its plastic handle/holder meant that it wasn't "dishwasher safe." I thought, well, maybe I can push it out of the plastic, so I picked it up and pushed on the bottom; not too hard a push, but obviously too much: the bottom broke and my hand jammed into the broken part. I knew immediately that this was big trouble.

After a crazy search for the cellphone (which was in my pocket, but I was lying on the floor fighting off shock and didn't realize that) we called Mary and Gilles and told them that I was going to need stitches and we really needed their help. Our friend Jamie offered advice on what hospital to go to, advice we gratefully followed. Mary and Gilles immediately jumped in their car and came to take me to the emergency room in the town of Nemours. There, they took x-rays, looked over things, cleaned and bandaged the cut, and made an appointment for me at a well-known hand clinic 45 minutes away from us. 

Yesterday, Gilles drove us to the clinic and guided us through the process. An examination in the morning, surgery scheduled for the afternoon. The surgery went perfectly. The doctor, who spoke excellent English, told me that the glass had missed the tendon in my thumb but had grazed the nerve, so he sewed up the nerve, tidied everything up, and put in six stitches. So now I have a big bandage on my left hand, and will for a week or so.

This happened to my left thumb, but I think most of you know that some nerve damage that occurred to my right hand some years back means that I use my left hand for anything requiring fine motor skills, so losing that hand while this thing heals is a big problem. Fortunately, I can still hold a glass of wine.

The doctor said I had to change the bandage every other day, the thought of which made me queasy. But it turns out that a nurse will come to the house to do that. Phew!

So we're on a deviation for a couple weeks (I go back to have the stitches removed in two weeks). But all is well, I'm okay, likely no permanent damage done, though the doctor did say that my thumb may have "reduced sensation." 

Sometime in the future I'll write a bit about my experience in the hospital and hand clinic. France usually ranks at or near the top in its healthcare system and so it was interesting to see and be part of it. My only complaint is that the gurneys were too short for me; I hung over both ends - and I spent about two hours doing that!

Now, we just cannot thank Mary and Gilles enough for all their help through this adventure. They went <em>way</em> "above and beyond" the call of duty for us.<br>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Medical-01.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Medical-01.jpg" alt="Medical-01" width="576" height="324" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-412" /></a>
Me and my supplies

Post-trip edit: The emergency room visit, at which they examined the wound, cleaned it up and bandaged it, took x-rays and scheduled me for the hand clinic the next day, cost $192. In the U.S. that surely would have been in the $1,000 - $1,500. The hand clinic was an examination, surgery and a follow-up appointment: $3,200. I can only imagine how much that would have been in the United States; surely $10,000 at least. The nurse came to the house six times over the next two weeks to change the dressing and we never saw a bill for that.

Between the two health care policies I had, these costs were covered 100%.

My impression of this experience is that the facilities I visited were not very modern, but the care was top-notch.

Too funny that you remember that phrase. When the Zumstegs were on a trip and got lost, Mom would always say,"We're seeing a part of 'wherever' that otherwise we would not have seen." Dad was seldom amused by that comment.

Thanks so much for reminding me of that!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've done most of our traveling in September, but some years ago we came to France in May and one strong memory we have of that trip was seeing the poppies in the fields. Last week, the poppies burst forth, and we love them as much now as then. Today, I have just poppie pictures, plus one other.

[gallery link="file" size="medium" columns="2" ids="417,404,403,418,402"]

<img class="alignright" id="blogsy-1371154943580.7812" alt="Kids on road" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/kids-on-road.jpg" width="291" height="432" />One last, non-poppie picture. The road by which I took those pictures goes from the small town of La Genevraye to the even smaller town of Cugny. We've driven this road a couple times and were surprised to find it barricaded the day we went to see the poppies. A sign on the barricade said that the road was closed for a school outing and while we were there, sure enough, here came the school. Evidently they closed the road so the kids could have an outing of walking from La Genevray to Cugny and back. Is that cool or what?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're glad it was "just another day," as it felt like we're getting back in the routine after our little adventure in the French healthcare system.

Today started with a visit from a nurse, to change the dressing on my thumb. Really, a home visit! She showed up about 11 o'clock - young, energetic, wearing regular street clothes, and, Laurie says I should include, quite beautiful. In ten minutes she had me fixed up with new dressing, in a much better fashion than the hand clinic had done. She, or one of her colleagues, will be here every other day to change the dressing; we understand it will cost less than $10 per visit!

When she took the old dressing off, I got a look at what I'd done to myself for the first time. Ugh. It is ugly. Really ugly. Pictures on request.

Then Laurie and I went to our local market, Carrefour, for groceries and a coffee-maker, to replace the one I broke. It felt good to get back to doing something normal.

Afterwards, we took a walk along our favorite route, the Canal Loing. We parked in the public parking at La Genevraye (population: 650) and saw this view of the Church here:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/la-genevrae-church.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/la-genevrae-church.jpg" alt="la genevrae church" width="274" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-447" /></a>
The first record of this Church is in the 13th century. It's unusual in that it sits on a hill outside of the town; most churches are surrounded by their towns. I learned today this church, <em>l'Egise de la Genevraye</em> will be open and have a display of its history on France's Day of Patrimony, September 12. We will definitely visit that day.

Then we walked along Canal Loing. Walking the section we walked today fills in a gap; we have now walked the canal from its entry into the Seine river upstream to Nemours, about seven miles in all.

Someday I'll post more about the canals. We've thought about why we enjoy them so much, and enjoy watching boats - particularly working canal barges -  go through the locks. We think it's because the canals and the boats are a part of an older France, a France that is disappearing. Fifty years ago, a lock on this canal would have seen fifty boats a day; today, maybe ten, of which two or three would be real "working" boats and the rest private pleasure craft or "float the canals of France" tourist boats. Progress, I guess, but I'm sorry to see this aspect of France disappear.

Here's a working canal boat, the "Thailand," in the lock at Episy.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thailand-3.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thailand-3.jpg" alt="thailand-3" width="243" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451" /></a>
You can see that these canal boats were built for the size of the locks. There is no more than a foot of clearance on each side, and maybe two or three feet of clearance on the length. The skill of the people operating them amazes us: they never touch the sides, they never have to go forward or backward to get positioned, they just gently ease into the lock and gently ease out when they've locked through.

Here's the Thailand, moving up the canal. That it's empty is apparent from how high it is out of the water. They go slowly; Laurie and I walked faster than the boat moved.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thailand-2.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thailand-2.jpg" alt="thailand-2" width="244" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450" /></a>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thailand-1.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thailand-1.jpg" alt="thailand-1" width="576" height="324" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-449" /></a>

Laurie spotted these poppies growing in what is essentially a heap of junk. 
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/poppies.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/poppies.jpg" alt="poppies" width="243" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" /></a>

All in all, a nice day, a day of getting back into the groove. As a bonus, the weather cleared late in the day and we had a glass or two of rosé sitting outside on the terrace. Sunset here is about an hour later than in Seattle (9:55 tonight), so if the weather is nice (a rarity so far), we can sit out pretty late.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry, bubbly-lovers, this is not a post about a quaint village we visited to taste some of that French nectar of the gods. Champagne-sur-Seine is a small town not too far from us, with an interesting (well, to us; you may find this quite boring) 20th century.

Those of you who suffered through my last Berlin blog will recall that Craig and I spent a day tracking down historic industrial buildings in Berlin, because the first real "factory that looks like a factory" was built there in 1910, designed by Peter Behrens. So when, a couple days ago Laurie and I drove through Champange-sur-Seine, which friends had told us was kind of gritty and not interesting, we perked up when we drove past some beautiful factory buildings. They were obviously pre-Behrens, because, as big as they were, they weren't really industrial-looking. Today, we returned to take a closer look.

In 1903, the Schneider Company, which manufactured electrical equipment, chose Champagne-sur-Seine for a new factory. The company built a huge factory and warehouse, and other companies followed. By 1923, Schneider employed 1,500 people in its factories, and the town had grown from 600 inhabitants to over 3,200. After the Russian revolution, the company brought workers from Russia; Champagne-sur-Seine still has a Russian Orthodox Church. Schneider also built a large number of apartments for its workers.

Schneider ceased operations in this plant in the 1990s. The buildings now have some industrial occupants, but employment has never come close to its peak with Schneider.

First, the Schneider buildings:

As we walked around the area, once jammed with other electric-industry-related companies, Laurie said, "This is a ghost town," and indeed it is. Many warehouses and factories remain, but few are occupied.
[gallery size= "medium" columns="2" ids="522,525,523, 547, 681"]

One interesting thing: the companies that have occupied these hundred-year old buildings are almost all high-tech companies, serving the electronic sector that was birthed by the electric industry. So what Schneider started in 1903 continues in a way.

As we walked around the town we came across a sports complex, now quite rundown, as the city and country just doesn't have the money to keep up a facility built when the town boomed. There are still tennis courts (in good shape and well-used, as tennis is popular here), a rugby field, soccer pitch, and play areas for kids. In the middle of this complex, for my bike-riding readers (that's you, yakibiker) a velodrome, not in good shape at all:
[gallery size= "medium" columns="2" ids="529,528"]

Champagne-sur-Seine has some beauty and style, too:
[gallery size = "medium" columns="2" ids="546,549,548,551,552,553"]

All in all, an interesting town that has fallen on bad times. One part of what we were told is true: it's kind of gritty. But it also has an interesting past and some fine ghosts. We liked it a lot.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Caution: Airplane geekiness follows! 

The Paris Air Show is, and has been since the first one in 1909(!), THE airshow; nothing is as big or as good. Airplane manufacturers all show their latest and greatest, and Airbus and Boeing fly their latest at the Paris Air Show. I've wanted to see it since I first knew about it, and that would have been some forty years ago. Today, thanks to our friend Gilles, I was able to be there. For a plane-loving geek like me, it was great!


The day started badly, though: at about five in the morning, we were awakened by a horrendous, and I do mean <em>horrendous</em> lightning storm. For ninety minutes, we had brilliant flashes of lightning, followed <em>immediately</em> by deafening crashes of thunder, and deluges of rain. "Well," thought I, "This is going to make the air show problematical." But Gilles and I persevered, as the forecast was for the weather to clear some and become hot - mid-80s hot. 

We took the train to the le Bourget stop (the airshow is at the le Bourget airfield, where Lindberg landed after his solo transatlantic flight in 1927), and, as we got off the train, the skies opened up again. Fortunately we had umbrellas so we forged ahead to the shuttle bus and headed for the field. Then, just as we stepped off the bus at the entrance to the airfield, the sky lit up with a flash of lightning, and the clouds opened with a downpour. We found shelter and waited it out, but there were hundreds of people in lines to get in, many in business suits, who were standing in the open and getting soaked to the skin. 

Anyway, we finally got through the lines, received our entrance badges and made our way in. After wanting to do this for so long, I was at the Paris Air Show:
[caption id="attachment_569" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/entrance.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/entrance-300x168.jpg" alt="Wet." width="300" height="168" class="size-medium wp-image-569" /></a> Wet.[/caption]
We first went into one of the exhibit halls, just to see the extent of this place. There simply is NO way to describe how big it is, but here are pictures I took from one spot, forming a panaorama. This shows maybe a hundredth of one of the smaller of the exhibition halls.
[gallery links="files" ids="572,573,574,575,576,577"]
I suppose I could find somewhere how many aviation-related companies were present, but it has to be in the thousands, anywhere from Airbus and Boeing to companies making tiny airplane parts. (Ok, I just looked it up: 2,244 exhibitors. There were 126 airplanes on display.) Amazing.

Many companies display their aircraft on the flight line. I apologize for the quality of these pictures; it was a very bright day by now, with lots of glare, and my poor old point-and-shoot camera had a hard time dealing with it. Heck, I had a hard time dealing with it! Anyway, here are some flight-line pictures:
[gallery link="files" ids="571,570,562"]

One highlight of the flying demonstrations was by a French fighter, the Dassault Rafale; the things that pilot did were amazing. But the real highlight was the British Airways Airbus A380, doing steep climbs, turns and dives right over the airfield, all under a thousand feet or so; this flying demo was just amazing.
[gallery link="files" ids="564,563"]
An hour later, the Boeing 787 took off, with this pretty spectacular climb from the runway (note the landing gear still coming up):
[caption id="attachment_578" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/b787-4.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/b787-4-300x192.jpg" alt="Dreamliner take-off" width="300" height="192" class="size-medium wp-image-578" /></a> Dreamliner take-off[/caption]
After that start, the Dreamliner flew a more sedate show than the A380 - don't know why. Still, it was pretty amazing to see, and there were several 787s on the flight line, so we were able to see it close up. We also stood right under the tail of the British Airways A380; geeze, that airplane is BIG!

Le Bourget has a museum of flight, so there are some older airplanes there. In the midst of all these sleek modern aircraft was this Lockheed Super Constellation, designed in the early 1940s (the co-pilot on the first flight of the prototype was Eddie Allen, later President of Boeing) and flown until jet aircraft pushed it into obsolescence in the early 1960s. Maybe it's just me and my love of old airliners,  but I think the Connie still looks beautiful, even when (maybe especially when) it's surrounded by modern airplanes.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/connie.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/connie-300x168.jpg" alt="connie" width="300" height="168" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-568" /></a>
After the Dreamliner demo flight, Gilles and I were pretty tired. This place is definitely sensory overload for us airplane geeks! So we headed for the train station and home. As a fitting end, the train went through what may be the worst storm squall I've ever seen: rain so hard you couldn't see two hundred yards, so dark all the lights were on (though it was five hours before sunset), lightning and thunder all around us. When we got to the train station at Bois le Roi, where Mary picked us up, she said she had never seen rain so hard as that storm brought.

Many, many thanks to Gilles for getting the Air Show tickets (it's by invitation only until Friday, so he had to do quite a lot to get them) and for taking me there, guiding me through the train stations - always an adventure -  and around the air show. It meant a great deal to me to be able to attend the Paris Air Show, after wanting to do this for so many years. Merci beaucoup, Gilles.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Brocante</em> appears in the www.wordreference.com French-English dictionary translated as "bric-a-brac," "second-hand," and "junk." After visiting the Montigny-sur-Loing <em>Brocante Nocturne</em> (<em>"nocturne"</em> because it went from noon to midnight), I lean toward the third of those definitions.

<em>Brocante</em> seems to be a big deal here. Every town holds a <em>Brocante</em> day and the people who sell stuff at them seem to go from place to place, following the schedule. Honestly, I don't know how anyone makes any money at this, and I don't know why anyone would spend every Saturday setting up their stand and sitting, hoping for customers or why anyone would spend time looking at this huge collection of...er...junk.  But there are people who love searching the <em>Brocantes</em>, hoping, I guess, to find that remarkable bargain. Good luck with that, is my opinion.

Anyway, here are some pictures from Montigny's day (and night) in the <em>Brocante</em> spotlight.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The weather forecast for today was promising (meaning: no rain, if also no sunshine) so we set off for a ramble to the medieval town of Provins, about an hour away. For once the forecast was accurate, and we had a fine day; well, we didn't get rained on. First, we visited St. Loup-de-Naud, a tiny little town near Provins.

<h3 font-family="helvectica">St. Loup-de-Naud</h3>
I wish I had some history of this tiny town. It has a grand total of 894 inhabitants, and an over-sized church. The church was built by Henri "the Liberal" who lived in the mid-1100s and was Count of Champagne. Somehow relics associated with St. Loup (I know nothing about him) had arrived in this town and Henri wanted a church to venerate them. So he funded this church. 
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_4984.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_4984.jpg" alt="Eglise St. Loup" width="576" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-703" /></a>
Unfortunately the church was closed; a sign on the door from the City Hall dated two years ago said that it would be closed "until further notice;" no reason given.

But the town of St. Loup-de-Naud was beautiful, and a little mystifying. Every house in it was beautifully maintained; not one ringer. Most towns have a mixture of houses, from some big and beautiful and well-maintained to small and not-so-well-kept-up. We have no idea why this tiny place had residents with the money and inclination to keep every single house beautiful. Here are some pictures of St. Loup-de-Naud.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_4996.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_4996.jpg" alt="IMG_4996" width="256" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-686" /></a>

<h3>Provins</h3>
Provins is a medieval town that realized it had an attraction: being a medieval town. Older guidebooks describe it as "picturesque town that has retained its rural feel." Well, maybe not so much. Since that was written 35 years ago, Provins has drawn on its charms and become a tourist destination. So it wasn't quite the pristine medieval city we'd expected. But it is still interesting and worth seeing.

Now, the first surprise was that Provins was <em>full</em> of elementary school kids. This is the last week of school in France, and evidently it's also school-trip week. There were thousands of kids here. Actually, it was kind of a kick to see them all. 
[caption id="attachment_690" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_5009.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_5009.jpg" alt="Main Gate to Provins.

As we always like to do, Laurie and I found a small path around the lower part of the town and walked it. We wondered where (and if) it was going to end. Finally we saw a couple stairs to a doorway in the back a series of houses that formed a wall. Up the stairways, through the doorway, and here is what we saw:
[caption id="attachment_724" align="aligncenter" width="256"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_5012.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_5012.jpg" alt="Quite an impressive way to enter the old town." width="256" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-724" /></a> Quite an impressive way to enter the old town.[/caption] 
Provins has a most interesting church. The same Henri the Liberal mentioned in the St. Loup comments built St. Quiriace; well, he started it. A bit of church architecture will help explain this church.

Medieval churches were generally built in the shape of a cross. The top part of the cross is the Choir; here is - you guessed it - the choir, and also the altar. The Nave is the bottom part of the cross, below the cross-arm; it's here that the congregation sat for masses. Then there are two Transepts, each one of which makes up one side of the horizontal arm of the cross. They all meet at the Crossing, which usually has a dome or steeple on it.

Now this church, St. Quiriace, got started right. Henri the Liberal built a big Choir:
[caption id="attachment_695" align="aligncenter" width="256"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_5022.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_5022.jpg" alt="The choir of Eglise St. Quiriace. This part was built in the 12th century." width="256" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-695" /></a> The choir of Eglise St. Quiriace. This part was built in the 12th century.[/caption]

Then something went awry and construction stopped, <em>for four hundred years.</em> Then the Nave was added, but it was only a pretend nave, maybe 40 feet long. The church should have had a Nave several hundred feet long, with maybe fifteen bays (arches along the side walls) but this one stopped at two bays.

Construction was again delayed, but this time for only three hundred years. Then the transepts were built, except they aren't really Transepts, but stubs where Transepts were to be built someday.

It appears that no one has been in a great hurry to finish St. Quiriace, as today, 400 years after the last "temporary" part was built, the church remains uncompleted. I'm thinking it may not get done soon.

Provins has beautifully maintained fortifications. We walked in what was once the moat.

In all, a rewarding visit and a nice day. But we were glad to get back to Montigny and a glass or two of rosé!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>La Rochelle - Introduction</h3>
We went to the seaside town of La Rochelle this weekend, to celebrate our anniversary, and because we have wanted to see La Rochelle for some time. The city has an amazing history, and it features in a number of the stories of our favorite detective, Chief Superintendent Maigret of the Paris Police Judiciary. In the understatement of the trip so far, we can say that La Rochelle did not disappoint.

We decided to stay at the Hotel Les Brises. This recommendation came from Ina Caro, the author of two of the best books on traveling in France, "Road from History," and "Paris to the Past." (If you're planning a trip to Paris or France, you pretty much <em>must</em> read these books.) Les Brises is about a 25 minute walk along a seaside promenade into La Rochelle proper, and there are few more enjoyable walks in the world.

Our room at Les Brises was, well, sublime. The view was not bad...

[gallery size = "medium" link = "files" columns="2" ids="761, 749,734"]
Hard to beat that view; we spent a <em>lot</em> of time sitting on that terrace and watching the world - and hundreds of boats of every description - go by.

La Rochelle is a most interesting place, with an amazing history. I'll divide La Rochelle comments into a couple sections, so you won't have to read them all at once. The first will be on La Rochelle's history.
<h3>History of La Rochelle</h3>
La Rochelle is an old, old city; there are records of Eleanor of Acquitaine giving it, in 1199, a charter upholding its rights as a free port, rights first received in 1137 from Eleanor's father. This right of being independent was the pivot point of La Rochelle's long history as a battleground between France and England. When Eleanor of Acquitaine divorced the French king Louis VII and married Henry, Duke of Normandy, she controlled nearly a third of present-day France, and when Henry became Henry II, King of England, all those lands in France became English territory. Not a good thing for peace between the two countries, and the cause of the Hundred Years War, during which La Rochelle yo-yo'ed between France and England, depending on who had the upper hand at the moment. However, in all the turmoil, La Rochelle, heavily fortified, was never conquered.

The reason for that is largely its location: on a peninsula with an excellent port. The land approaches to the city were well-fortified and easily defended. The port, its lifeline when the city was attacked by land, kept the city supplied with food and weaponry. Two towers were build to protect the port. The two towers stood on either side of the entrance to the port and still stand today:

[caption id="attachment_732" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC03112.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-732" alt="Towers protecting the harbor." src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC03112.jpg" width="576" height="324" /></a> Towers protecting the harbor.[/caption]

The left tower is the Chain Tower. For hundreds of years, every night a huge chain was strung from it across the harbor to prevent ships from slipping in at night.

This worked until the early 1600's; then things changed.

La Rochelle, in its independence, had long been a Protestant city in a Catholic country. Though the city had a legal right to be Protestant, a right guaranteed by kings for centuries, in the 1620s Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII's main minister, decided to bring La Rochelle to heel; religious tolerance was not his strong point. Since then city had never fallen to an army, Richelieu decided to starve it into submission, gathered an army and in 1627, laid seige to the city. Among the soldiers in that seige army: Artos, Portos, Aramis and D'Artagnan - the Three Musketeers and their friend, the protagonist of Dumas' Three Musketeer books.

La Rochelle wasn't worried - the English had promised they would lift the siege and, until they could, they would supply the city with food using ships to bring it in. Then two turning points: in England, the Duke of Buckingham, who had suffered a humiliating defeat when he made a half-hearted attempt to break the seige, was assassinated by a Puritan fanatic the night before his much-reinforced fleet sailed, and the assault was canceled; and Richelieu had a dike built across the mouth of the port: no ship of any kind could enter. Fourteen months later, La Rochelle surrendered, its population of 28,000 starved to fewer than 5,000 survivors.

Next to our hotel were these three concrete slabs:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_7328.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-745" alt="Concrete Slabs" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_7328.jpg" width="260" height="384" /></a>These are said to be the only remaining pieces of Richelieu's dike: they have been here since 1627! Personally, I'm skeptical. The builders of the dike would have used stone and these are concrete, and not very good concrete. I doubt they would have lasted four hundred years. Having said that, it is indeed the location of the dike, and the bar visible at low tide would be the rock laid down for the base of the dike.
<h3>La Rochelle: Friday</h3>
We arrived in la Rochelle about 4 o'clock Friday afternoon after a longer than expected drive. First delay was me relying on a French highway website that plotted our route and took us a long way round to the autoroute. Second was about 45 minutes of crawling down the autoroute, caused by two big trucks that tangled somehow; they were by the side of the road, with their trailers completely torn apart.

We drove through downtown La Rochelle to our hotel. Downtown was completely enveloped in smoke. Turns out the Hotel de Ville (not a hotel in our sense of the word, but a major city building), was burning. The Hotel de Ville has been there since 1298, and will surely be restored again - it has had more than one fire in that history.

After a "toes-up," as the British say, we sat on our little terrace for a glass or two of wine, and then walked into the city. We had read of a excellent seafood restaurant, but our Rough Guide map of the old city showed the location off the map. We didn't know how far off the map so we headed through town. Turned out, it was a long way off the map.

After about an hour and a half of very enjoyable strolling, we found the restaurant, Marie Galante. Small and informal, they were able to seat us. Though they had a nice menu, we had one thing on our minds: <em>moule frites</em> (mussles and fries). There they were on the menu and soon - voila! - there they were in front of us:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC03114.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-733" alt="DSC03114" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC03114.jpg" width="216" height="384" /></a>
The restaurant was a delight. The walk back, at a slow pace, wasn't so much. We arrived at the hotel after 11 p.m. When we told the desk clerk the next day where we had walked, she got an amazed look on her face and said, "Eight or ten kilometers!" That would be 5-6 miles. Yes, our feet confirmed that. Worth it for those <em>moules</em>.
<h3>La Rochelle Saturday</h3>
Cooler. Wetter. Really low clouds. After an excellent breakfast, we walked into and through town. Someone not too long ago realized that La Rochelle has a great asset in its waterfront, so all of our 25-minute walk into town is along a beautifully developed park and waterfront promenade:
[gallery columns="2" size = "medium" link="files" ids="735,757,758"]
La Rochelle is, as mentioned, an ancient town. It differs from many other places of similar age in that it seems to have been preserved rather than restored at some point. It has blocks and blocks of buildings with arcaded first floors holding shops and stores of all sorts, and apartments above them. If you removed the cars and changed the shops to what they once were, you'd see La Rochelle as it has been for six hundred years. It is an amazing experience, honestly.
[gallery size = "medium" link = "files" columns="2" ids="756,755,754,753,752,751,750,738,739,740,743"]

That night we celebrated our anniversary at the restaurant <em>Le Thiers du Temps</em>. It was just great: a small place, holding only twenty people; food was sublime; the woman serving spoke some English and we spoke some French and she was delightful. Food? No way to describe it. Oysters for entrée, monkfish and risotto for main course, a chocolate conconction for Laurie's dessert and for me? A mousse of <em>fourme d'ambert</em> (a blue cheese), with whipped cream and a couple tiny and powerful cherries. Yes, it was unusual but I've become a fan of <em>fourme d'ambert</em> cheese so I had to try it, and I'm glad I did.
<h3>La Rochelle Sunday</h3>
Sunday was a slow day; we did almost nothing even though the weather had turned perfect. We watched the boats sail out of the harbor, I walked into town to take a couple more pictures, and Laurie got to dip her toes in the Atlantic, standing on Richelieu's dike.
[gallery size="medium" columns="2" ids="759,760"]

A couple other miscellaneous pictures:
[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="744,742,747,766"]

Well, I didn't mean to drag on so long, really. We loved La Rochelle and are already trying to figure out when we can return.

Update: we made reservations to return to La Rochelle for Laurie's birthday in early September.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[La Rochelle went straight into the top tier on our "Favorite Cities of the World" list. A large part of this enamoration is surely because Laurie and I always like places on the water - rivers, lakes, oceans, whatever - and it's hard to be away from the water in La Rochelle. Another big thing was the "preserved, not restored" aspect I mentioned in the post. The place has lots of restaurants and cafés around the old harbor, but it has the feeling that they've been there as long as La Rochelle has been there. And away from the harbor the buildings look much as they must have 500 years ago.

We've already booked the hotel for a return trip in September, and we didn't even plan to go to La Rochelle until after we arrived in France.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One thing about an extended trip such as ours is that we have to do some normal, everyday things that generally get skipped on a vacation. Today, I got a haircut. I admit that I had been kind of dreading it, since I've been going to the same barber shop back home for twenty years and I just <em>knew</em> that it would be different here.

First, there are no barber shops here. Hair salons - <em>les coiffures</em> - are for men and women. 

Second, oddly enough, they don't speak English in them like back in Renton. So I talked with our friend Mary who gave me an idea of how it would go, and off we went (Laurie went along, since she wanted to share the adventure; also, she is better than me at hearing French). 

Third, no such luck as to be able to walk in and get <em>une coupe</em>. Gotta make an appointment for <em>midi et trant</em>, go back home, then return to <em>Le Coiffure</em> (the actual name of the place) at 30 minutes (<em>trant</em>) after noon (<em>midi</em>).

We did just that, returning right at 12:30. I waited a few minutes, as there was only one woman doing the cutting and she was just finishing up with a woman. Then, a shampoo (never had that in Renton) and into the chair. Fortunately, Mary had said the woman would ask me how I wanted it cut and sure enough, she did. I had prepared an answer, gave it to her and - miracle of miracles! - she understood. She asked me a couple more questions about how short I wanted it and so forth, got out her tools and had at it.

I don't know how to describe the difference between a haircut in Renton and the haircut today. In Renton, my barber (also a woman) cuts away, talks to me, talks to others in the shop and pretty quickly, I'm out the door. The woman today worked as if she were painting a work of art - she concentrated on every clip of the scissors, she did this 'n' that, she trimmed here and there, went back to "touch up" some areas, all the time giving it her total concentration. It was really enjoyable to watch her do her work.

Last thing: she used a straight razor to clean up around my ears and sideburns; I tried to remember the last time a barber used a straight razor on my haircut and I can't think when it was, but surely thirty years ago.

She finished, brushed me off and said, of course, "Voila!" I paid her (just a little more than my Renton haircut) and Laurie and I left in a flurry of <em>merci's</em> and <em>au revoirs</em>. 

Haircuts have always seemed to me to be a necessary evil - they're just something you have to do. Honestly, today I left <em>Le Coiffure</em> looking forward to when I need another one. And glad to have done another everyday thing here in Montigny-sur-Loing; we came here to live like the French; surely getting a haircut is about as mundane and everyday as can be.]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Paris - Canal St. Martin]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some years ago, on our first stay in Paris, I read about a boat ride on Canal St. Martin. We decided that it would be a perfect first-day, recovering-from-jet-lag activity for that trip: two and a half hours of sitting and floating through an interesting part of Paris. It was, indeed, a perfect first-day activity, and a walk along Canal St. Martin has become our favorite walk in Paris. So today, our first real day back in Paris, we walked Canal St. Martin.

The canal starts at the Seine River, just upstream (east) from Ile St. Louis and Ile de la Cité. Bassin Arsenal, where there are quite a few pleasure boats (and from which one of the two canal boat rides starts) forms the first stretch of the canal, then it goes underground for about a kilometer, emerges and passes through five locks up to Bassin La Villete. When we first discovered Canal St. Martin the area around it was more working-class than much of Paris; in the intervening twenty years, it has become more gentrified, but still retains a good blue-collar feel.

Napoleon ordered the construction of Canal St. Martin in 1802. At that time, this was truly a blue-collar part of Paris, and one reason for the canal's construction was that it provided a barrier to the eastern parts of the city, from which rebellions against the current regime always arose (much of the French Revolution was fueled in Faubourg St. Antoine, east of where Canal St. Martin was later constructed). 

Today, Canal St. Martin is a testimony to Paris understanding that a head-long rush to progress isn't always a good thing. There remains no real economic need for the canal and, indeed, in the early 1960s a movement arose to  fill it in and create a highway in its place. Cooler heads prevailed and today Canal St. Martin, with its many pedestrian bridges, automobile bridges, locks and areas to just sit and enjoy life, is a beautiful and restful oasis in the middle of a very busy and noisy city.

After dinner Friday, we strolled around the area in which we were staying, turned down a little street, and saw this:

It was a gathering of Harley-Davidsons, their owners, and enthusiasts. The whole lot of them, in full regalia - leathers and all that - were standing around, looking at Harleys, talking about Harleys and drinking champagne from flutes. France - crazy and wonderful.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been here almost two months now and we've come to know our French "home town" pretty well. We're kind of known - the folks at the <em>boulangerie</em> know I'll be every day or so and know that, though I order almost the same thing every time, I will still slaughter their language. It really does feel like home now.

By popular demand (Laurie's), I'm just going to post some pictures of Montigny-sur-Loing (which means, "Montigny on the Loing River").

[caption id="attachment_874" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7680.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7680.jpg" alt="A road sign on one of four routes into Montigny. The photo isn&#039;t crooked; the sign is." width="576" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-874" /></a> A road sign on one of four routes into Montigny. The photo isn't crooked; the sign is.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_876" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7688.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7688.jpg" alt="An overview of Montigny, from rue de Point of Vue , of course. This is the old part of the town; there is a larger more modern part, too." width="576" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-876" /></a> An overview of Montigny, from <em>rue de Point of Vue</em> , of course. This is the old part of the town; there is a larger more modern part, too.[/caption]

Three public buildings, all new. I suspect they were built five years or so ago. We can see the old City Hall (the "<em>Mairie</em>") near the new one and it is small and worn out.
[gallery link="files" size="medium" columns="2" ids="867,864,901"]

<b><font-family="Helvetica">Our Street, <em>rue Montgermont</em></b>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7612.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7612.jpg" alt="Montigny-sur-Loing" width="256" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-855" /></a>
Yes, this is a two-way street. The rule for right-of-way is easy: if you're on the side with the parked cars (they're allowed to park on only one side), you yield right-of-way to any car coming up the street. That means you have to tuck in between parked cars somewhere. At first, I thought this was difficult and a little nerve-wracking, but as there are streets like this everywhere, in towns smaller than ours and Paris, I've become used to it and don't even break a sweat. Unless it's a bus coming the other way...

<br>There are also lots of streets that use a technique to slow down traffic: they allow parking on one side at any point in the street, but what side cars can park on changes every 100 yards or so, which means the right-of-way changes also. On those streets you really have to watch to see where the on-coming cars are in relation to where you are so you know if they have priority or if you have priority. I've got it figured out, so I'm comfortable with it, but Laurie, as the passenger, still grabs the dashboard frequently.<br><br>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7610.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7610.jpg" alt="Montigny-sur-Loing" width="256" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854" /></a>
A side road, which is the best way out of town from our place. Fortunately, it is one-way (though we have seen cars coming the wrong way down it) and no parking is allowed (except for a couple non-running cars at the top), so driving this street offers no thrills.


<b><font-family="Helvetica">The shops of Montigny:</b>
[gallery size = "medium" link = "file" columns="2" ids="870,868,858,857"]

<b><font-family="Helvetica">Our <em>Boulangerie</em></b>
A <em>boulangerie</em> is, of course, a bakery, and this is a top-notch one. We know that people from surrounding towns - towns that have their own bakeries - come to Montigny for their baguettes and bread and desserts and cakes. I'm not going to argue with them; the products here are simply fabulous.
[gallery size = "medium" link = "file" columns="2" ids="856,865,860"]

Sunday is the big <em>boulangerie</em> day. Sunday lunch is a tradition: families gather, have a big early-afternoon lunch, and spend the day together. This requires, of course, lots of bread and a few desserts. So there's a line-up out the door, and you'll see people leaving with half a dozen baguettes and a couple boxes of the fantastic cakes available here. 

Some things a French person can do at Sunday lunch that are generally not acceptable any other day: have wine (really; wine at lunch is not a common thing in any French household but ours); put butter on your bread (yes, really); put butter on your radishes, the typical lunch-starting snack. Really.

<b><font-family="Helvetica">The Loing River.</b>
We found a beautiful park on the Loing River.
[caption id="attachment_877" align="aligncenter" width="571"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_76721.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_76721.jpg" alt="Looking across the Loing River, you can see the old town and Church.

I suspect if it had stayed open, Laurie and I would have kept it open this summer." width="571" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-877" /></a> Looking across the Loing River, you can see the old town and Church.

While we were in the river park, these school kids came and waded into the river. It was a class of 10- and 11-year olds, boys and girls. Things are different here:

- for wading, the boys stripped to their underwear and went in. Can you imagine the ruckus that would have caused in the US? Girls screaming, guys totally embarrassed. Here? Nothing.

- while they were wading, the teacher (male) went into the woods to take a whiz. Surprisingly he wasn't smoking. We've seen several school outings where the teachers are with the kids and smoking. 

<b><font-family="Helvetica">War Memorial</B>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7662.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7662.jpg" alt="Montigny-sur-Loing" width="246" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869" /></a>
<em>Every</em> town in France has a memorial to the town's war dead, usually enscribed "To the infants of <em>insert town name</em>, killed for their country." World War I devastated the young male population of France. It's common to see a town of a thousand people with 30-50 names on the memorial. How the country had enough men to raise families and re-populate itself after the war is a mystery to me. We <em>always</em> stop to look at the memorials and remember the sacrifice and, mostly, to think what a total waste war is.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7682.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7682.jpg" alt="Montigny-sur-Loing" width="289" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875" /></a>
Most of the World War I population is gone now, but this woman surely remembers World War II and life under the Nazis.

One other thing we like: sunset is about an hour after Seattle's. I'm wrapping this up at 9:47, working at the table in our courtyard, and I could work without additional light for another half-hour, at least. Very nice.

So that's Montigny-sur-Loing. We love it here. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The town of Fontainbleau has a huge market three mornings a week, Sunday being the biggest. We've been many times with Mary and Gilles, but last Sunday we ventured into it on our own. I won't say it was without its moments, but we were successful:
<br>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7605.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_7605.jpg" alt="Fontainbleau Market" width="576" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-852" /></a>
In the plastic container is paella, made in two huge paella pans right in the market. The woman makes two pans of paella and when it's sold, she goes home. It was delicious, as good as we've ever had in Spain. 

Other purchases:
- cherries, which are finally in season and really, really good.
- radishes.
- lettuce. I'll take a picture of a head of lettuce by itself sometime; they are huge and Laurie says the best she's ever seen.
- cheese - three kinds plus a local specialty: a concoction of cheese and other stuff that ends up as a dessert. This is the second cheese dessert I've had, and we've seen several others we'll give a try. 

The only language problem we had was when the cherry man told me the price and I didn't quite understand. It was 5.90€; I got the 5€ part, but in French, 90 is "quatre-vingt dix;" that is, "four twenties and ten." I just didn't pick that out, and the clerk, with humor, took the correct change from my handful of coins. Could have been worse, I guess: 98 is "quatre-vingt dix-huit:" four twenties, ten and eight. Crazy language! ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We spent Wednesday afternoon, Thursday and Friday morning in Paris this week. Our friends Mary & Gilles have graciously allowed us to stay at their apartment in Paris whenever we want, and I can tell you that it's quite nice to be able to go in, stay a night or two and know that we don't have <em>do</em> everything on our list of things we <em>want</em> to do; we can do them next trip. 

Wednesday night we went to the Louvre, as it's open Wednesday and Fridays until 9:30 and we hoped that the hordes of tourists might have thinned out later in the evening. We went specifically to see the new Islamic Art exhibit, as we have seen lots of Islamic art in southern Spain over the years and like it a lot. There weren't many people in that exhibit, so it was nice and quiet.

I won't be be able to say anything new about the Louvre. To say it's huge understates its size; "hugely-immensely-monstrously-amazingly-humongous" touches on it. Here is one hall that contains a <em>part</em> of the Louvre's Italian painting display:
[caption id="attachment_921" align="aligncenter" width="202"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03169.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03169.jpg" alt="The other half of one hall containing Italian paintings. This hall does not contain all the Louvre&#039;s Italian paintings." width="202" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-921" /></a> The other half of one hall containing Italian paintings. This hall does not contain <em>all</em> the Louvre's Italian paintings.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_922" align="aligncenter" width="210"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03168.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03168.jpg" alt="One half of one hall containing Italian paintings." width="210" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-922" /></a> One half of one hall containing Italian paintings.[/caption]

And, of course, I have to show my standard, every-visit picture of people taking pictures of the <em>Mona Lisa</em> (which, in French, is called <em>La Joconda</em>, the French spelling for <em>La Gioconda</em>, its Italian name). I read one Internet discussion about the Mona Lisa that had this typical phrase in it: "...people stand there for a long time contemplating its beauty." No, they don't. People come in, pull out their cameras or cellphones, take a picture of the painting, and leave. I have never seen one person contemplating the painting. Do you seen anyone here contemplating the Mona Lisa?
[caption id="attachment_920" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03171.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03171.jpg" alt="People taking pictures of the Mona Lisa. Why?" width="576" height="324" class="size-full wp-image-920" /></a> People taking pictures of the Mona Lisa. Why?[/caption]

For me, there are hundreds of paintings in the Louvre that I'd rather see. I am definitely underwhelmed by the Mona Lisa.

We left about 9 p.m. Here's the very tired crowd outside the pyramid. It was a hot day and I suspect many of these people had sensory overload - the Louvre is crowded and noisy. 
[caption id="attachment_919" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03177.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03177.jpg" alt="Tired people outside." width="576" height="127" class="size-full wp-image-919" /></a> Tired people outside.[/caption]

And please! what is it with people taking young kids there? There is nothing in this entire museum that a six- or eight- or ten-year old kid is going to enjoy. We saw lots of tired, cranky kids being dragged around by tired parents at 8 o'clock at night. Crazy.

More on our Paris days to follow...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Warning: history follows!

On the eastern edge of Paris, outside the Périphérique (the highway that surrounds central Paris) one can step back into the 14th century with a 15-minute Metro ride. Today, rather than take that 15-minute Metro, we took a 30-minute bus ride into the 14th century and it was amazing.

In the 12th century, the French monarchy decided it really needed a hunting ground near Paris - I mean, after all, who wants to go to an actual forest to hunt? So inconvenient - and so built a hunting lodge, with an enclosed hunting ground to keep the game close-by - I mean, after all, who wants to actually hunt for something before shooting it? So tiring - at the Bois de Vincennes. In the 14th century, Charles V converted the hunting lodge to a fortress, with an enclosed community, strong walls, defensive towers and, in the middle, a huge keep, also known as a donjon, that would protect him against any invaders that penetrated the first set of walls. And despite the audio-guide's assertions that Charles V did that to protect himself against the English in the Hundred Years War, all other histories say he did it because he hated Paris and its residents and they reciprocated the feeling. Charles V, King of France, was scared to death that Parisians would attack and overpower his army.

Regardless, the Chateau de Vincennes stands today, much as it was when Charles V lived there from 1364 to 1380. The walls stand, two of the four gates into the fortress remain, and most impressively, the keep itself has been restored to as it was in the 14th century. Here's the keep:
[caption id="attachment_936" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03182.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03182.jpg" alt="The Keep" width="576" height="324" class="size-full wp-image-936" /></a> The Keep[/caption]

The main gate was called the Town Gate, because it opened into the town of Vincennes, not that anyone from the town of Vincennes was <em>ever</em> allowed to enter the fortress. This is the current view of the Town Gate from the town:
[caption id="attachment_940" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03189.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03189.jpg" alt="Town Gate, from the town" width="576" height="324" class="size-full wp-image-940" /></a> Town Gate, from the town[/caption]

Here's what the chateau area looks like from the top of the Keep's walls. This shows maybe 20% of the area enclosed by the Chateau de Vincennes.
[caption id="attachment_934" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03178.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03178.jpg" alt="View from the walls of the Keep" width="576" height="127" class="size-full wp-image-934" /></a> View from the walls of the Keep[/caption]

These places, while beautiful today, were cold and dark and essentially nasty, particularly during winters. Here is the fireplace in Charles V's main chamber; that should have kept him warm:
[caption id="attachment_935" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03180.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03180.jpg" alt="Now here&#039;s a fireplace" width="576" height="324" class="size-full wp-image-935" /></a> Now here's a fireplace[/caption]

Finally, Charles V build a church in the chateau, called St. Chapelle, same as the St. Chapelle on Ile de la Cité in Paris. Like the St. Chapelle of Paris, it was meant to hold a holy relic, in this case a thorn from the Christ's actual Crown of Thorns.

In previous blogs, I may have stated my disbelief about all these relics. If you gathered together all the pieces of Christ's Crown of Thorns or all the pieces of Splinters of the True Cross, you'd have a dumpster full of thorns and a tree trunk of wood splinters. When a King went on a Crusade, he <em>had</em> to bring back something to show what a good thing he'd done. And the people of the lands he invaded knew that, and many a monarch was sold many a fake. 

Anyway, Chateau de Vincennes fascinated us. There was almost no one here; I guess it's too far outside the tourist track to draw in many folks. But if you're interested in seeing where a king lived in the 14th century, this is the place to go. It's well worth that Metro ride.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We love to walk in Paris. I'm not sure there's a better city in the world for walking, so we do a lot of walking. Here are some highlights of our walks in Paris this last week.

<b>Berges de Seine</b>
<em>Berges</em> means the banks of a river. I have, since our first visit to Paris 20 years ago, wished that there were more places to sit and watch the activity on the Seine. Well, no more will I wish that. Two weeks ago, Paris opened up a section of the river on the Left Bank, from Pont d'Alma to Pont Royale, that is 100% for sitting, walking, resting, eating, drinking and just watching. It is fabulous.
[gallery size = "medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="953,951,952,954"]

<b>Parking</b>
It seems that you can park anywhere in Paris as long as three things are observed:
1. There's not a "No Parking" sign to be seen;
2. You don't block an intersection (sometimes ignored);
3. You don't block a crosswalk (often ignored)

This picture shows a few cars obeying the parking rules: there's not a "No Parking" sign; they're not blocking traffic; and they're not blocking a crosswalk. Hence, parking like this is fine. Note that both black cars are parked here; it looks as if the right-hand one is driving around the corner, but no...it's stationary.

Actually, it also seems that you can disregard the above three rules if you just put your blinkers on. That seems to make parking <em>anywhere</em> okay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We traveled the last few days with our friends Mary and Gilles Germain. I had asked that we do a ramble to include two Renaissance chateaux in the Burgundy region, so Mary and Gilles put together an itinerary that included the two, the excellent town of Langres, and a new place to us - Troyes (pronunciation to be explained later). I'll do a post for each of the two chateaux, then one on Langres and one on Troyes. Here is our visit to Chateau Tanlay.

We arrived after a pleasant couple-hour drive from Chartrettes, where Mary and Gilles live and from which we started our ramble. We parked, walked to the chateau, looked at the building below and said, "Hmmmmm, beautiful, but not all that great a chateau."

[caption id="attachment_976" align="aligncenter" width="4097"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03239.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03239.jpg" alt="Our first look at Chateau Tanlay" width="4097" height="2178" class="size-full wp-image-976" /></a> Our first look at Chateau Tanlay[/caption]

We walked a little farther and, well, sheepishly realized that what we'd seen is the <em>gatehouse</em> to the chateau. This was not to hard to figure out when we saw the actual chateau:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03271.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03271.jpg" alt="Chateau Tanlay" width="4608" height="2592" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980" /></a>

Renaissance chateaux are not terribly common in France, as most chateaux were built before the Renaissance. Tanlay (and Ancy-le-Franc, of which more in the next post) are even rarer in that they were designed by Italian architects, who had learned their business in Italy at the height of the Renaissance there. Renaissance chateaux are marked by perfect proportions and geometrical design, where earlier chateaux, derived from earlier defensive castles and designed by French architects, show some remnants of defensive structures.

We could see the interior only if we purchased the $12 guided tour. After some hemming and hawing, we thought, "Wait, what are we doing? We drove all this way and we're not going to spend twelve bucks to see the place?" So we got our tour tickets and off we went.

The tour and the chateau were worth every freaking centime. The chateau was built between 1550 and 1568; it was acquired by the current owners in 1705. They still live in a wing of the chateau. I was asked to take no pictures during the tour, so I have nothing to show, except this picture I snuck in that shows some detail a wing of the chateau:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03253.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03253.jpg" alt="Chateau Tanlay" width="2592" height="4608" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978" /></a>

Some interesting history occurred in this chateau, but as it occurred in the 1570s, you might not be interested...
[gallery size = "medium" link="files" ids="979,977"]

And finally, three happy travelers. Chateau Tanlay, not on any tourist guide itinerary, fascinated us. We agreed that we were all very glad I'd asked to visit it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After our visit to Tanlay, we drove the short distance to the small village of Lézinnes, where Mary had reserved rooms at a <em>gite</em> - a French Bed-and-Breakfast. Our arrival was not without trial. First, Mary said the <em>gite</em> was at 4, <em>rue de la Gare</em>, so down <em>rue de la Gare</em> we drove and when we arrived at number 4, here's what we found:
[caption id="attachment_993" align="aligncenter" width="4188"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03279.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03279.jpg" alt="Our B&amp;B for the night?" width="4188" height="2453" class="size-full wp-image-993" /></a> Our B&B for the night?[/caption]
Fortunately, we (fairly) quickly saw the <em>gite</em> at number 5, <em>rue de la Gare</em>:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03278.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03278.jpg" alt="Gite at Lézinnes" width="4080" height="2315" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992" /></a>
But one last hiccup: the woman who owns and runs the <em>gite</em> was sitting outside, enjoying the sun, and said she had no reservation for us - had never heard of us. But no one else was there, so she could offer us rooms. (Turns out that she did, indeed, have a reservation, but she had somehow missed it in her reservation book.) Anyway, the <em>gite</em> was quite nice, and had a lovely breakfast the next day.

That evening we went to a restaurant that Mary and Gilles had been to some time before (and did not have exactly good memories of, but the <em>gite</em> owner thought it had changed hands since then). We arrived, found it had not changed hands, but decided to give it a go. It was maybe ten tables, outside beside the Canal de Bourgogne, and was a very pleasant surprise. The food was excellent, the wine very nice, and the setting - alongside the canal on a warm evening - delightful. 

The next day we made the short drive to the Chateau Ancy-le-Franc. This is another Renaissance chateau and, like Tanlay, was designed by an Italian architect, so it is pure Renaissance, and purely beautiful. A big difference between the Chateau Tanlay and Chateau Ancy-le-Franc is that while Tanlay is still owned privately and so limited in how much money is available for maintenance and restoration, Ancy was purchased by a foundation some years ago, which has poured a <em>lot</em> of money into restoring it. 

Chateau Ancy-le-Franc is just simply beautiful. It adheres to Renaissance architectural rules: symmetrical throughout, simple ornamentation, everything tied together. 
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03304.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03304.jpg" alt="Ancy-le-Franc" width="4608" height="2592" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03294.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03294.jpg" alt="Ancy-le-Franc" width="2387" height="4308" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03292.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03292.jpg" alt="Ancy-le-Franc" width="4608" height="2592" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03291.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03291.jpg" alt="Ancy-le-Franc" width="4479" height="2519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994" /></a>
People who know architecture say that the courtyard at Chateau Ancy is the most beautiful Renaissance construction in France, and among the best in the world. Who am I to argue? I can only say that yes, indeed, it was beautiful.

We took an audio guide tour of Chateau Ancy, which was informative. The chateau's rooms are much the same as when they were built or redecorated over the years. Again, though, photography was not allowed inside, so I've got pictures of the exterior only:
[gallery size="medium" link = "files" columns="2" ids="1001,1000,997,996"]

And when we left, there was Gilles, who had gone a bit ahead of us, waiting patiently.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03323.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC03323-576x1024.jpg" alt="Gilles" width="576" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1002" /></a>
As we walked out, we went through the town of Ancy-le-Franc's market. Most towns have such markets, and they are always interesting to visit.[gallery columns="2" size="medium" link="files" ids="1005,1006,1007,1008"]

After that, it was a drive to Langres, a town we'd visited last trip and were looking forward to seeing again, and to a dinner at a restaurant we all loved last trip.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is our second visit to Langres. We've found that when we told someone here that we were going to Langres, the universal response was "Why?" Langres has nothing of note to draw tourists. But readers of our 2010 blog, when we also visited Langres, know why. 

In the 1950s, the American writer Elliot Paul visited Langres and wrote about it in a book about his travels in France. Here's what he wrote about Langres:

<blockquote>The old city, and there is no other, covers the top of a hill, one of the foothills of the Vosges. The wall still stands, and one may walk on top of it, around the city, and on the outside is the fertile plain, those white roads lined with poplars, on hilltops red-roofed villages set off with stately trees, surrounded by farms that make patchworks of color in concentric bands. Inside the city you will find the Middle Ages you have heard so much about, and you will learn that they had something we have lost, and lacked much we have discovered. There is nothing else remarkable about Langres, few relics in museums that bring pilgrims hence, no restaurants whose specialties are watchwords of gourmets. The food is excellent and plain, and not expensive enough to be frenziedly praised. You will tread stones that were old when Columbus sailed the seas, if you care for treading stones. You will look into windows out of which the age of chivalry has passed, leaving behind its aroma and flavor. You will feel the ache of wondering what was the past, of what is now, and what, if anything, shall be. You will not be talkative on the way back toward Paris, and home.
</blockquote>

That, in one paragraph, sums up what we love about Langres and about small towns everywhere, I think. It certainly reflects why Laurie and I love to go to small towns and stay in them. We see a part of the country that simply doesn't exist in the cities. 

Anyway, Langres, 2013. We had a bit more time this trip to just walk and see Langres, and I can say that it still fits Elliot Paul's description. Nothing notable, but something special. Rather than write about it, I'm just going to present some photographs.

<b>Walls - Langres does indeed have walls</b>
[gallery size = "medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1061,1062,1063,1066,1049,1052,1051,1060"]
<b>Streets of Langres</b>
[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1067,1050,1054,1057,1056,1055,1058"]
<b>Buildings</b>
[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1069,1068,1059,1048,1047,1046,1045"]
<b>And a fountain</b>
[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1064,1065"]

One huge disappointment: in 2010 we had dinner at the restaurant in our hotel here and encountered the culinary surprise of the trip: superb food, presented beautifully, served with style and grace, in a restaurant where our expectations were not high. We all looked forward to another great evening of dining at that same restaurant in Langres.

Alas, 'twas not to be. The restaurant has changed names since our last trip, and likely chefs and owners. For a $40 menu, our first course was two - count 'em - two gambas, on skewers, stuck into a daub of some mediocre paté. Main course for three of us was a fish from the Loire River, the sandre. There must have been a shortage that night, because our servings were about 2 ounces each, really; each of us got a piece that was about 1 inch by 2 inches by three-quarters of an inch thick. And that was all that was on the plate, except for a tiny potato - maybe an inch round - cut in half. Dessert was nougat glacé, which is available in 90% of the restaurants in France, except in 90% of the restaurants in France, you get a decent-sized serving; this was a disk of nougat glacé about an inch in diameter. Honestly, we could not have had more than five ounces of food in the three courses combined and none of those five ounces even reached the level of average. What a disappointment! Our dinner on the Canal Bourgogne the night before was far better, at a far lower price.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's Sunday night; we're in Paris at Mary & Gilles flat, on our way to Berlin tomorrow. We're looking forward to seeing the "Red Tomato!"

Explanation: my Aunt Marjorie, after Craig, Annie and Clara spent three or four days at her house, called Clara "the Tornado." We added the "red" part, then Mary read an email about the "Red Tornado" and mis-read that phrase. She thought we'd called Clara "the Red Tomato." And so we've called her since.

Anyway, we'll be there mid-day tomorrow. We are <em>sooooooooooooooo</em> excited to see Craig and Clara. Annie is at a conference until Saturday (the Gordon Research Conference of Microbial Adhesion and Signal Transduction - those microbiologist know how to live large!), and we will be <em>sooooooooooooooo</em> happy to see her when she returns.

And we're excited to be back in Berlin. Although not high on most travelers' wish lists, we love Berlin and find it a fascinating city. I am sure I'll walk down my favorite street in the world - Karl Marx Allee, originally named Stalinallee when it was built in the early 1950s - at least once. Twice. Maybe three or four times. Photos to follow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, let's start with the pronunciation of the city of Troyes. One would, at first glance, think it was pronounced as we pronounce "Troy" in English; I mean, after all, there are only two lousy letters tacked on to the end, and everyone knows that in French, you don't pronounce the 's' at the end of a word, and the 'e' only serves to force the pronunciation of the letter before it, so it's "troy," right.

Well, no. This is French, remember? So here's a little help. The French word for the number three is <em>trois</em> and is pronounced "twa." Totally ignore that you think maybe it would be a good idea to actually pronounce the 'r' in the middle or the 's' at the end, and that 'oi' might be pronounced like it looks. Anyway, now that you know how to pronounce <em>trois</em>, you also know how to pronounce <em>Troyes</em> because, although <em>trois</em> and <em>Troyes</em> don't look a lot alike, they are pronounced exactly the same. Yep, exactly the same. Crazy language.

But I digress... Troyes is an interesting city. It's big - population of some 65,000 plus probably an equal number in the area. In terms of famous people, not so interesting, though Pope Urban IV (Pope from 1261 to 1264) was born here. Joan of Arc and Charles VII freed the city from the English in 1492. 

Troyes' claim to fame is that, for some reason, the city has maintained hundreds of half-timbered buildings in the downtown area since the 16th century. Recently, the city has revamped that downtown area to remove automobiles and leave the area to pedestrians; as a result, many restaurants and bars and stores have thrived here. I will post below some pictures of the streets and buildings of Troyes; during the day - and especially on a hot Friday evening - these are jammed with folks. If you want to see them without the crowds, be there at 7:30 in the morning...

<b>Troyes Buildings</b>
[gallery size = "medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1108,1107,1103,1099,1100,1095,1094,1093,1092,1089,1088,1086,1070"]

<b>Streets</b>
[gallery size = "medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1117,1118,1106,1105,1102"]

<b>Iglise St. Madeline</b>
I wanted to see this church because my guidebook said it has one of the few remaining "rood screens" in France. The rood screen - <em>jubé</em> in French - was a partition between the nave, where the parishioners sat for a Mass, and the choir, where the priests conducted the Mass. This <em>jubé</em>, besides being one of the last, is one of the most ornate - an example of Flamboyant Gothic sculpture.

It was, indeed, worth seeing, but better were the stained-glass windows. Created in the 16th century, they are beautiful and unusual in two respects: they have been recently restored; and they are down low, so a person can see them quite clearly. In many churches, the stained-glass is so high in the walls that it's difficult to see them in detail. 
[gallery size = "medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1111,1113"]

We liked Troyes, though it's not high on our "return-to" list. We wouldn't make a special trip back here, but if we were in the area, we'd probably return, if for no other reason that to see those windows again.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Z,

A quick story about our grand daughter fix.

A couple of weeks ago Melanie had a job as a sub for the English as a second language class.  Michele volunteered to baby sit Lise for the week so Melanie could do it.  I decided to visit for a couple of days.

I decided to make a road trip out of it and drive the TT down instead of fly.  Yes, this makes sense.  Two days to drive down, two days to visit, two days to drive home.  The penalty was that this was to be an I-5 blast, not a red road tour.  Oh Well.

I left the day before Michele so that we would get there at the same time.  So far, so good.  On the second day, I was having lunch with a cousin from my mother's side of the family in Red Bluff, CA.  Michele calls to let me know that the flight she was on had flown half way to the Bay Area and had been turned back and had been sent back to Seattle because of the Asiana crash landing.

She found out quickly that getting to the Bay Area was going to take a couple of days.  Solution that she came up with-she booked a flight to Sacramento and her loved one picked her up there after she parachuted down.  I had company from SAC to SFO!  Wow.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Berlin has a fascinating political history, which is on full display for those willing to look a bit. We have had the great fortune to have an amazingly knowledgeable guide to show us this aspect of Berlin and explain it to us in terms we can understand (that would be Craig, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of Berlin). Today I'll write about some things the East German Communist government left behind and how they appear today.

By the early 1950s, the German Democratic Government (GDR), which was largely a puppet government of the Soviet Union, was firmly in charge in the east Berlin sector allocated to the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Housing was in very short supply still, and so the GDR decided to build a street of apartments that would a.) add to the pool of housing; and b.) show the world that the GDR was providing excellent living conditions for the "workers." The result, named Stalinallee, still exists and is, I think, one of the most intriguing streets I've ever seen. (I might point out that Stalinallee has been named "Karl-Marx-Allee" since 1961.)

For about a mile and a half, Stalinallee was constructed with apartment buildings that were different, but similar in height and general design, so the street has an amazing architectural coherence that exists in few places. It is 100 yards wide, with four lanes of traffic, sidewalks thirty feet wide and trees down both sides and on a median strip. It is, as the GDR planned, an impressive sight. Today, many of the buildings have been renovated to repair the damage of years (just because the GDR had the money to build them didn't mean it had the money to maintain them) and contain desirable - though very small - apartments and stores. 

Okay, I know: a picture is worth a thousand words...
[gallery columns="2" link="file" size="medium" ids="1168,1169,1170,1171,1173,1174,1172,1175"]

Though the apartments on Stalinallee were said to be for the "workers" (who, I might add, rebelled in 1953 at the low pay and high hours they had to work; the resultant suppression of the rebellion by Soviet armed forces took at least 125 lives. So much for the "happy workers" building a "workers paradise!"), it didn't work out that way. As the apartments were completed, nearly all went to Communist Party functionaries; few workers actually lived here. In 1961 there was a discussion - of sorts - about re-naming the street, since by then it was known and publicly acknowledged that Joseph Stalin had been a murderous thug of the worst kind. Arguments for and against the renaming raged, but the German Democratic Republic, which wanted the renaming, won, in the way it won most arguments: it ignored the opposition. One night a huge statue of Stalin disappeared without a trace, and all the street signs were changed from Stalinallee to Karl-Marx-Allee; overnight, Stalinallee was no longer.

Stalinallee, Karl-Marx-Allee: makes no difference. I think this street is one of the most interesting and beautiful streets anywhere. I can't imagine a visit to Berlin without a stroll down it.

Then we went to another Communist monument that went awry. Ernst Thälmann was the leader of one of the two communist parties in the 1920s and early 1930s. Unfortunately, the two communist parties spent so much time and energy fighting each other that the Nazis were able to take control, to the detriment of every communist in the country. In 1934, Thälmann and many others were arrested by the Nazis. Thälmann spent eleven years in solitary confinement, was then transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp and executed there in 1944.

After World War II, the communist East German government mythologized Thälmann as a hero of the anti-fascist workers of Germany. When a new housing area was developed, it was named after Thälmann and a huge monument was raised to him. Here's a picture of that monument, which still exists (note that Laurie is showing solidarity with Thälmann, with that raised fist); this is a HUGE freaking monument - over 40 feet high:

[caption id="attachment_1177" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_8034.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_8034.jpg" alt="Laurie shows solidarity with Ernst, with a fist and a determined look." width="600" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-1177" /></a> Laurie shows solidarity with Ernst, with a fist and a determined look.[/caption]

The disintegration of East Germany pretty much put paid to the myth of Thälmann. Research showed that many of his heroic anti-fascist activities were, well, myths. In fact, it turns out that he was far more interested in fighting other communists. But mostly, no one cared anymore about "anti-fascist workers' revolution" leaders; today, his monument is pretty much ignored and unmaintained. Why isn't it torn down, you might ask? That possibility has been raised and the result has been that because the thing is so big, no one knows how to tear it down. So it remains, unloved and ignored. But I have to say, it was pretty amazing to visit this monstrosity, and think of the efforts at propaganda made by the German Democratic Republic.

<b>Lenin</b>
In 1917 Vladimir Lenin was in exile in Switzerland. As the Russian political scene descended into chaos, he wanted to return to Russia and lead the Revolution, but no country would allow him to transit through (he was pretty well-known as a trouble-maker). Finally, the German government arranged for him to transit Germany in a sealed railway car. He arrived in Berlin at one station, from which the railway car had to be shipped overland to another station, the one shown below. It was from this railroad station that he (and 30 followers) left Berlin, next stop: Russia and Revolution. Interestingly, he disappeared from sight for eight hours while in Berlin and it's thought that during those eight hours, he received a huge amount of funding from people or groups unknown - maybe the German government, which wanted to de-stabilize its long-time foe, or a private financier - because he left Switzerland almost penniless and arrived in Moscow with tons of money to finance the revolution.

<b>Templehof Airport</b>
The Templehof Airport may be the most historic airport anywhere. In 1948/1949, it was the airport where almost all the planes of the famous Berlin Airlift landed. Today, the field and its amazing buildings remain, but not as an airport. The buildings are being converted to offices and the field, with runways and taxiways intact, are open to the public, for walking, running, riding and general enjoyment.

Laurie asked me to add some info about the Berlin Airlift, so:

After WWII, Berlin was composed of four sectors, one each controlled by the Soviets (East Berlin), France, Great Britain and the United States (those three sectors together comprising West Berlin). The four countries were supposed to jointly govern Berlin, but it was, of course, the Soviet Union against the Allies all the time, and the Soviets wanted to control all of Berlin. In 1948, the Soviet Union decided it could force the Allies out by blockading all land and river routes to Berlin; the Soviets believed the Allies could not and would not expend the effort to keep West Berlin (which was essentially an island in Soviet-controlled East Germany) alive, and the Soviets would be able to establish control over West Berlin.

They guessed wrong. The Allies launched an unprecedented airlift to supply West Berlin. Because West Berlin was completely cut off from West Germany, the Allies had to fly in everything – food, coal, equipment, everything. After a rocky start, the Berlin Airlift settled into an astonishingly effective routine: airplanes left three airports in the West carrying supplies, flew to Templehof Airport, where they were unloaded quickly,and returned to the West. At its peak, airplanes landed every 30 seconds, 24 hours a day. Crews were given coffee and food at their airplanes (served by hand-picked young German girls); if a plane approaching Templehof could not land for some reason (the preceding plane not clearing the runway quickly enough, for example), the plane aborted the landing approach and flew back to its home base; there was no way for it to re-enter the landing pattern without disturbing the flow of flights.

[caption id="attachment_1217" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_8054.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MG_8054.jpg" alt="A somewhat tired C-54, the type of airplane that flew the most part of the Airlift supplies. It could carry about ten tons per flight." width="600" height="252" class="size-full wp-image-1217" /></a> A somewhat tired C-54, the type of airplane that flew the most part of the Airlift supplies. It could carry about ten tons per flight.[/caption]
In the eleven months of the airlift, Berlin was supplied with an astonishing total of over 2,236,000 tons of supplies, including over 1.4 million tons of coal and an entire coal-burning electricity generating plant.

In May 1949, the Soviets realized the Allies could continue to supply Berlin as long as necessary. Without ever admitting defeat they announced that the “technical problems on the roads and railways” that had closed them had been corrected, and land traffic could move again. Afterwards, Berlin settled into clear East-West sectors that went their separate ways and by 1951, there was no pretense of Berlin being one city - it was a communist East Berlin and a capitalist West Berlin. This was most clearly seen when, in 1961, the Soviets erected the Berlin Wall.

<b>A wrap-up of Berlin...</b>
I doubt we would have ever come to Berlin had it not been for Craig and Annie moving here in 2008. For that, we are grateful to them, because we really like Berlin. Its many-layered history fascinates us, in all its manifestations of buildings, monuments, cemeteries, parks, streets and ghosts around every corner. Craig and Annie and Clara will almost certainly be moving back to the States in the next six-nine months, so this is probably our last night in Berlin. But this city will always hold wonderful memories for Laurie and me, of Berlin itself, and of the wonderful times we've had here with Craig and Annie and Clara.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, our trip to Saint-Pierre-Quiberon requires a little up-front explaining, as most of you know Laurie and I are <em>not</em> beach people, and Saint-Pierre-Quiberon is most definitely a beach community.

Our friends Jamie and Hervé Rufin have been vacationing in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon for seven or eight years, and raving about how much they love it there. This year we were in France when they went to Saint-Pierre, so they invited us to join them (and our other French friends Mary and Gilles). Because our Berlin trip had already been scheduled and booked, we were able to spend only three nights with <em>les Rufin</em>, so we also booked a hotel for two more nights, after they and the Germains left. We knew we would have a wonderful time with <em>les Rufin</em> and <em>les Germain</em> but, honestly, we weren't too sure about Presq'ile Quiberon.

Well, not to worry; we did, indeed have a wonderful time with the Rufin family (daughter Sophia and son Alex were with us there) and the Germains.  We also learned why Jamie and Hervé return to this place: it is just beautiful and charming and fun and all the things a special vacation place needs to be. We returned today (August 4) and we were quite glad that we woke up to rain, because we would have hated to leave if the weather had been good, as it was when we were there.

Rather than boring you again with lots of words, I'm just going to post some pictures. All I can say now is that we are so thankful that Jamie and Hervé asked us to share their "special place" with them, and that we hope we can do it again in the coming years. This is a part of France I'm not sure we would have seen had it not been for Jamie and Hervé inviting us and urging us to join them, but I can tell you that Saint-Pierre-Quiberon has become a special place for us, too.

<h3>Saint-Pierre-Quiberon and the Bay</h3>
Some sights around the town. We all went swimming in the bay and I have to say that, after that initial getting-wet shock, it was wonderful. Been a long time since we swam in salt water; I hope it isn't so long to the next time.

<h3>The <em>Cote Sauvage</em></h3>
That translates as the "wild coast" and wild it is. Believe it or not, Hervé, Alex and I went swimming in this surf!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sunday we drove half an hour and went back 5000 years. 

The town of Carnac has the largest set of <em>megaliths</em> in the world (a <em>megalith</em> is a large stone embedded upright in the ground by human activity). The megaliths of Carnac are in alignments: long rows of megaliths. Carnac has three main alignments; the largest is ten rows of menhirs, each row with over one hundred stones, stretching over three-quarters of a mile. The second is eleven rows, again almost three-quarters of a mile long; and the third is thirteen lines, about half a mile long. In all the alignments, stones start small at the east end and increase in size, to where the western-most stones are ten-twelve feet high and weigh many tons.

Why do these alignments fascinate us? As Laurie says, "It's nice that there are still mysteries in this world." The menhir alignments of Carnac were likely created around 3,300 BC - almost 5,000 years ago; more than a thousand years before the first pyramids were built in Egypt. No one knows why they were created, what they signified to their builders or how they were created (how did fairly primitive cultures quarry, move and erect stones weighing so much?). But here's an interesting clue: remember the menhirs I showed that are in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon? These menhirs are about 40 miles from Carnac, across open water, but they seem to align with some of the Carnac menhirs to mark the location of the moon at a certain point in its cycle. Other menhirs around southern Brittany mark other points in the lunar cycle. Just saying...

Anyway, we love the Carnac alignments. Here is a how the largest field looks from an observation tower:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you travel around enough, you will surely encounter some things you just could not expect. The harbor of Auray gave us just that experience.

We drove to Auray when we left Carnac. Mary had told us that the old harbor of Auray is beautiful. Gilles pointed out that it also was historic, in that Benjamin Franklin landed here when he came to France in 1776, seeking France's help in the United State's Revolutionary War. So off to the small, sleepy harbor of Auray we went.

First hint that something was going on: the parking lots around the harbor area were full, on a Sunday afternoon. Second hint, as we walked down the hill to the harbor, we could hear yelling and cheering and what sounded like someone announcing a contest on a loudspeaker. Hmmmm, something was not as we expected.

We turned the corner to the harbor and saw that the area was jammed with people, all of whom were watching something in the water. We pushed to the fence and saw... well, let me show you some pictures. 

First, a boat rowing out into the harbor. Note the guy with the long pole on the back. Note also that the team is dressed in Mexican garb, including sombreros, serapes and fake mustaches.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8465.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8465.jpg" alt="_MG_8465" width="600" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1325" /></a>

Another boat, with another oddly-dressed team, was coming from the other direction. They rowed like crazy toward each other and we realized that it was a boat-joust - the guys with poles were going to try to knock each other into the water. 

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8468.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8468.jpg" alt="_MG_8468" width="600" height="341" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1326" /></a>

Closer...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8469.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8469.jpg" alt="_MG_8469" width="600" height="351" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1327" /></a>
Closer...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8470.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8470.jpg" alt="_MG_8470" width="600" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1328" /></a>

Closer...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8471.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8471.jpg" alt="_MG_8471" width="600" height="334" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1329" /></a>

Splash!

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8472.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_8472.jpg" alt="_MG_8472" width="600" height="342" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1330" /></a>

Sure enough, the Mexicans won this joust, as the guy from the other team got knocked off his perch and into the water. This was all accompanied by frenzied shouting from spectators lining the waterfront.

I later saw a scoreboard - there were sixteen teams in this tournament! We do not have the slightest idea why this team was dressed in pseudo-Mexican costumes. I will say that if I were from Mexico, I'd have been offended!

Now, the other crazy thing is that about a minute after we turned that corner, I said to Laurie, "We've been here!" And we had been there. Nine years ago we spent some time with Laurie's former boss at the library, Jeane, and her French husband, Bertrand. We all went to Carnac, and Bertrand took us to this very harbor afterwards. So, it was deja vue all over again, except that nine years ago the place was deserted and today it was jammed.

And, truth to tell, the Auray harbor isn't all that interesting. It has been "gussied up" to attract the tourist trade and it is just so pretty and so quaint and so inauthentic. Give us a real town any day!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just when we think we've got it all figured out here...

Yesterday Laurie took the train to visit Mary for the afternoon. Now, trains here run right on schedule; we know that the trains from Paris stop at Bois-le-Roi (the stop for Mary & Gilles) and leave there at <em>exactly</em> 51 minutes past the hour, arriving in Montigny (our town's stop) twenty-six minutes later. Every hour from 5:51 a.m. to 11:51 p.m. Except...

After a fine afternoon together, Laurie and Mary, knowing that the train leaves Bois-le-Roi at <em>exactly</em> 51 minutes after the hour, get to the Bois-le-Roi station a few minutes before 5:51. Sure enough, at 5:50, a train rolls in, stops for about a minute, and starts off, now with Laurie on it. It makes a stop at Fontainebleau, then at Moret, then at Saint-Mammès.

At this point, Laurie is thinking, "Saint-Mammès? We've never stopped at Saint-Mammès before," and she sees the Seine River along side the tracks, which she has ever before seen on the Bois-le-Roi to Montigny trip. Panic builds. The next stop is Montereau, where everybody gets off, as the train has reached its final stop. Laurie gets off, too, finds a railroad employee and asks just how in the heck did she get to Montereau when she wanted to get to Montigny and just how in the heck is she going to actually get to Montigny? The employee, recognizing panic when he sees it, takes Laurie into an air-conditioned office with a bunch of SNCF workers, where they get Laurie's cellphone out and call Mary - our landline number here wasn't in the phone, Laurie couldn't remember it and, as you'll see in a minute, it wouldn't have helped if she could. They do find Mary's cellphone number and call it. Mary answers and Laurie tells her she's in Montereau, because the train never stopped in Montigny. (In fact, the train never went through Montigny.)

So Mary calls me on our landline. I see that it's Mary so I answer, but I can't hear a thing. She calls again, with the same result. Our landline handset has decided that this would be a good time to act up. Mary then sends me an email asking me to call her. Fortunately, I was on the laptop, so I got it immediately, told her the phone was on the fritz and asked what was up. "Laurie's in Montereau, that's what's up." Could I go get her?

So I drove to Montereau - about twenty minutes away - and parked at the <em>gare</em>. No Laurie. I looked around, started toward the platforms, and here comes Laurie, with one of her rescuing SNCF workers. We thanked him, got in the car, came home and had some wine. Had <em>copieuse</em> wine, in fact.

Turns out that the trains southbound to Montigny leave Bois-le-Roi at fifty-one minutes past every hour <em>except the 4, 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon trains.</em> For those three hours the Montigny trains leave at 41 minutes past the hour, and there is conveniently a different train at 51 minutes after the hour that splits off to a different route after a couple stops and ends up in Montereau. But Laurie and Mary and Gilles didn't know about the different departure time and so when the fifty-one-minute-after-the-hour-train arrived in Bois-le-Roi, Laurie figured it was the regular Montigny train and climbed aboard. Simple, eh? Except, of course, it wasn't the train to Montigny; it was the train to Montereau. Laurie wants me to note that the trains are not marked with their route anywhere; you just have to know what train goes where.

Laurie was so thankful for the help that she gave her SNCF friends a jar of home-made apricot jam made by Mary that morning that she was bringing home. I'm sure they enjoyed that treat as much as Laurie enjoyed her wine when we got home.

Just another adventure...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've had lots of folks who wanted to come and stay with us, and it has pained us that we just don't have enough room for everyone here in Montigny-sur-Loing. So we decided to look for a place we could rent that has a little more space, a few more bedrooms. Today we found the ideal rental, nearby in the town of Fontainebleau, and with lots of room for everybody:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03753.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1375" alt="Fontainebleau" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03753.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></a>
It even has a couple extra wings, in case more people arrive, and a nice area for swimming on those hot days:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03763.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1379" alt="Fontainebleau" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03763.jpg" width="500" height="253" /></a>

<h3>Fontainebleau Chateau</h3>
The building you're seeing is, of course, the Chateau of Fontainebleau. Although not as sumptuous as Versailles, it has a much more interesting history. Versailles was built by one person, King Louis XIV, during his 72-year reign from 1643 to 1715, so while it's over-the-top on ostentatious displays of wealth and power, it reflects only Louis XIV's ideas on art and architecture. Fontainebleau was built, changed and added-on to by many kings (and an Emperor) and so has a wider variety of styles and art. Having said that, much of it is over-the-top, too!

The oldest part of the chateau was built in the late 1100's by Louis VII (king from 1137-1180); it had a chapel consecrated by Thomas à Becket. Philip-Augustus (1180-1223) and Louis IX (1226-1270) made it their home chateau and lived there. But it was Francois I (1515-1547) who added much of what we see today. His son, Henry II (1547-1559) and his queen, Catherine de Medici, also added to the chateau and carried out extensive modifications. The chateau sits in almost 200 acres of formal gardens, and is in the center of the Fontainebleau forest, which was once a private hunting preserve for the monarchy, and contains 110 square miles(!).

Enough historic blather; here are some pictures of the Chateau:

And pictures of the interior:
[gallery size = "large" link = "files" columns="2" text-align="center" ids="1372,1371,1370,1373,1374"]

We took the audio tour of the chateau. We skipped a couple parts of it and still spent two-and-a-half hours walking through one spectacular room after another. In that 2-1/2 hours, we saw maybe 1% of the rooms in the chateau!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tuesday Laurie and I headed north to Paris for a few days. Our nephew Brian and his wife Jennifer (I guess that makes her our "niece-in-law;" is there such a word?) arrived in Paris that day for their first visit and we were <em>really</em> looking forward to seeing them and doing some Paris stuff with them. We ended up staying until Saturday and we had a great time, when we did stuff with Brian and Jenn and when we did some stuff on our own. 

The first day we just did a walk around the two islands of Paris - Ile de la Cité and Ile St. Louis. I was able to bore them by telling stories about lots of stuff. But, hey, I did it for a reason: they had flown from Seattle and were a little jet-lagged, and they were able to catch a number of cat-naps while I told my stories. 

Anyway, next day we went to Musée Pompidou with its amazing collection of modern art. Now, I have to say that I am not a connoisseur of modern art, so I wasn't too sure about this expedition. But several friends had recommended that we visit the Pompidou, and I'm glad we did. There is a Roy Lichtenstein exposition there, and that was fabulous. The rest of the museum has works I liked and works I could only respond to with "Huh?"

We did some other fun stuff.

The next day we took a walk of Montmartre - probably the most well-known area of Paris. We took a walk (from the excellent book, "Walking Paris : Thirty Original Walks In and Around Paris," by Gilles Desmons) that started at the back side of Montmartre and wandered around the most interesting areas. The street below is <em>Villa Leandre</em>,  a row of private houses; I cannot imagine what these houses are worth, in this city of apartments. 
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03792.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03792.jpg" alt="Villa Leandre" width="864" height="486" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1411" /></a>
And we were not the only ones enjoying a beautiful day.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03785.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03785.jpg" alt="Montmartre" width="400" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1410" /></a>

But of course, the walk eventually had to go into the areas best known by the tourists, just because...because...ummmm...well, I don't know why. We saw lots of beautiful areas on the walk and then...

(Start of rant.)

I don't understand this at all. Place Tertre and the small area around it are not unlike Disneyland: everything is phony and gussied-up and quaint and meant to accomplish one thing: extract money from tourists. And the tourists come in hordes. I can name twenty neighborhoods in Paris that are more authentic and interesting than this part of Montmartre, but no one goes to them. Maybe it's a good thing that all these tourists are here and not ruining other neighborhoods. But I can't imagine why anyone would see this and think they'd seen Paris.

(End of rant.)

After our tour, we went a few blocks away from the scene above and introduced Brian and Jenn to a favorite Paris tradition: lunch at a sidewalk café. We had a wonderful meal, the weather was perfect and, well, you can see...

Further proof of my good friend Ken Disbrow's observation that the well-traveled path isn't very wide. We were no more that a ten-minute walk from the place where the picture above was taken. The restaurant clientele was French people, and us.

In an earlier post I commented on how Paris has opened up a long stretch of Seine riverfront, but I didn't have any good pictures. Laurie and I walked this again a couple days ago and I got some better pictures. We love walking along the Seine, have always wished there were more places to do that, and so are very glad this has opened. We hear that plans are underway to open up more areas.

<h3>St. Denis</h3>
Friday Laurie and I went to the Basilica of St. Denis, a twenty-minute metro ride north of Paris' center. St. Denis is famous for two reasons: it is the first Gothic cathedral built; and all the French monarchs (and most of their queens) were buried here and darn near every one of them had an effigy carved for their tomb. So St. Denis is a lesson in architecture and a lesson in art history, as we see the effigies change from medieval rigidity to Renaissance beauty. (The kings and queens themselves are gone, thrown into a common grave during the French Revolution.)

In her fabulous book, "Paris to the Past," Ina Caro writes about the revolution in architecture wrought by Abbot Suger, who built St. Denis in the mid-12th century. Before, the bishops and archbishops of France built and worshipped in Romanesque churches. Romanesque architecture is plain and low and powerful (and has its own beauty - Laurie and I love Romanesque and have made some long detours to see Romanesque buildings). Suger and his architects learned how to do away with the massive walls required by large Romanesque churches and replace them with weight-bearing ribs. That meant the space between the ribs could be anything, and Abbot Suget loved stained glass. So Suger put stained glass windows into his church, the first time that had been done.

Ina Caro describes the inauguration of St. Denis. Abbot Suger invited all the church higher-ups in France, they all arrived and, on the day of the inauguration, he escorted them into the Church. Remember, all these church authorities were from dioceses with low and squat and powerful Romanesque churches; here's what they would have seen when Abbot Suger opened the doors to them:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_0050.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG_0050.jpg" alt="St. Denis" width="384" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1406" /></a>
Caro points out that immediately after the inauguration, many churches around France had "accidental" fires, and were replaced by Gothic churches; the first replacements were built by the same architects and craftsmen that Suger used and Gothic architecture ruled for several hundred years. For example, Notre Dame, in Paris, had been started earlier as a Romanesque church; work was stopped and it was redesigned Gothic.

Anyway, seeing St. Denis was worth the trip out. I won't say much about the effigies because, while they were interesting to a history nut like me ("Oh, look, there's Francois 1st's tomb! And there's Henry IV's! Oh, boy!"), I'm not sure it's of interest to either of my faithful readers.

Friday night we went to dinner with Brian and Jenn, as the next day they were heading off to Berlin to see the Zumsteg contingent there (they'll have a couple days in Paris before they return to Seattle), and we saw this at sunset:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03818.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03818.jpg" alt="Paris" width="324" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1418" /></a>

After dinner, which was eminently forgettable except for a delightful waiter, we walked around the islands. So, one last Paris picture: Brian and Jenn.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03822.jpg"><img src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC03822.jpg" alt="Brian and Jenn" width="717" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1419" /></a>

We really, <em>really</em> enjoyed having Brian and Jenn here and wished it could have been longer. We think they may have caught the travel bug and the Paris bug, so they'll be back. Paris will still be here; we hope we are, too!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Wednesday we left, with Mary and Gilles, on a ramble toward the south. We really didn't go too far - our return trip, which was from the farthest point south, took less than two hours to get back to Montigny. But we did lots of enjoyable things and saw many interesting sights. Over the next couple days, I'll do some posts about this ramble.

Our itinerary:
Wednesday - drove to Briare. Along the way we stopped for an excellent lunch in Irancy, visited a winery, then drove to see an amazing sight for us canal-and-lock lovers: a set of seven locks, all on one unit, that mount a hill in Rogny, which is now know as Rogny-les-Sept-Écluses (Rogny of the Seven Locks). One interesting fact about these locks: construction started in 1605, was completed in 1629, and they were in use for 290 years!

Thursday - went back to Rogny-les-Sept-Êcluses for a walk along the old canal, then to see a famous bridge. The bridge - called the <em>Pont du Canal</em> carries a canal across the Loire River. We did some more searching for a couple old canal locks that we wanted to see, and finished with an excellent dinner in Gien.

Friday - off to wine country! First stop was that small town of Sancerre, in the region that produces the excellent Sancerre white wine. Lunch in a tiny village, a stop at a winery that produces the wine we had at lunch, then off to the city of Bourges.

Saturday - toured Bourges, a fascinating city, with a spectacular gothic cathedral and the private residence of Jacque Couer a 15th century merchant who almost controlled France. Wrapped up with a wonderful dinner.

Sunday - a quick look at a most unusual lock, then another canal bridge across another river and, as the rain started,a drive home.

I'll try to minimize the wordage about canals and locks; we find them infinitely interesting, but I doubt anyone else does. I'll try to do a post for each day, probably taking a day for each post, so over the next four or five days I'll have filled you in on the entire ramble. 

First up will be a winery visit and Rogny-les-Sept-Écluses. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Ramble II - Bailley and Briare]]></title>
		<link>http://zumsteg.us/?p=1474</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2013 14:49:44 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're off on another ramble! Our first stop is in Bailley, where we'll visit the <em>caves</em> of the local wine cooperative. This winery is known for sparkling wines - we'd call them champagnes except that a wine cannot be called a champagne unless it comes from the champagne region. The wines made here are made with the same type grape using the same process as champagne, but "champagne" they aren't and "sparkling wines" they are.

After the tour - not exactly exciting - we tried a couple of the wines. One was a regular white sparkling wine, the other a rosé. Now, I have to say, we are not fans of "pink champagne," so we were wondering about that rosé, but I can tell you that rosé sparkling wines are a long, <em>long</em> way from the pink champagne swill of years past. This rosé sparkling wine is really good - crisp and dry and just a touch of rosé; we split a case with Mary &amp; Gilles (note: in France, a case is six bottles, not twelve). Cost: about $11 per bottle.

Then it was off for a first look at the most unusual and most historical canal lock in France. Now, both regular readers of this blog will recall that Laurie and I really enjoy walking along the canals of France and seeing the locks in action, so we were looking forward to this one: a set of seven locks that go up a hill, constructed in the early 17th century and used for over 250 years. They are not, of course, used today, and the lock mechanisms are gone, but the lock structures are still there.

Here's what the Sept Écluses look like today:

When the Sept Écluses were replaced by a wider canal, there were 3,000 to 4,000 boats using these locks annually. I suspect each passage up or down the locks took about three hours.

Next day (okay, I'm jumping ahead here), we returned and walked along the canal - unused since 1889).

That really was it for the first day. So we went to our place for the next two nights: a B &amp; B. Now a few words about B &amp; B's...

Our experience with B &amp; Bs has not been all that great, and this one kind of fit in with that experience. It seems that French B &amp; Bs often want to give guests a room with Old French Charm (OFC). Unfortunately, OFC requires money, because OFC requires antiques, and money for decorating is one thing B &amp; B owners seem to lack. So the rooms get decorated with Old French Junk (OFJ). This B &amp; B - on a beautiful estate, with a beautiful garden and beautiful main house - was furnished in a style best described as ... um...er...well, I don't know what; OFJ, I guess. Pictures:

Fortunately, traveling with Mary & Gilles avoids the other complaint I have about B & Bs: making new friends at breakfast. The four of us can sit and talk about the day's plans or yesterday's activities or whatever - we have never run out of conversation topics. So I don't have to sit down and make nice with total strangers. I am definitely a morning anti-social guy, so talking with a bunch of people I don't know and will never see again is not my cup o' tea!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Both readers of this blog know that Laurie and I are fascinated by the canals of France. Honestly, we can't say why but we like to walk along them and we like to watch boats go through the locks. Most of the canals in France are no longer used for commercial boats; the Canal du Loing, which is near our French home of Montigny-sur-Loing, sees maybe two or three commercial boats a day, and we're not sure why there are that many. The canals now are almost exclusively for pleasure boats.

Anyway, today we saw an interesting canal sight: a canal bridge that crosses the Loire River: water crossing water. Pont du Canal ("Canal Bridge") was built in the 1880's; it was designed by Gustave Eiffel - he of the...well, you know.

We walked across the bridge, of course. The bridge was built for commercial traffic; there weren't any pleasure boats on French Canals in the 1880's. The bridge connected a canal network on the north side of the Loire with a canal network on the south side. Before the bridge, boats had to lock from one canal system into the Loire - which could be very fast and hard to navigate at times - and then lock into the other canal system on the opposite side. We saw those two locks, also, but as they haven't been used since 1889, I think maybe no one really wants to see pictures of them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Next, we drove to the town of Sancerre. I doubt anyone knows of Sancerre unless they like French white wine. The region around Sancerre produces a beautiful white wine. One small part of the city proper is a bit touristy, with lots of places to try and buy the wines of Sancerre. Other parts are quiet and beautiful:
[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1507,1508,1509,1510,1511"]

We had lunch in the tiny town of Cauvignol, famous for its <em>chevre</em> - goat cheese. There, we had a very nice bottle of Sancerre wine, so we went to the winery. For those who have been to wineries in, say, Napa Valley, this was a bit different. We found the winery, rang a bell on the door, and after five minutes or so, a woman came out of a house down the street. She took us into the room where the wines were bottled and stored, and poured us a couple tastes. We liked best the wine we had at lunch, so we bought a bunch of it.

We did not buy that much; Laurie and I bought six bottles, Mary and Gilles twelve, I think.

What a difference from a Napa Valley experience: no tasting fee, no fancy tasting room, no shirts/ball caps/books/posters/scarfs/glasses/whatever. Just "Here's our wine. Buy some if you like it." The wine we bought cost $11.45 per bottle. I looked it up on the 'net because the winery woman told us they export some to the United States. Sure enough, I found it: $24 per bottle plus tax plus shipping, a total of somewhere around $30 per bottle. No wonder we don't see much of it in the US of A.

One last comment. I love this about France: you're driving out in the middle of nowhere and come upon something like this:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know I owe the blog a post on the city of Bourges, and I promise I'll get to it, as Bourges was quite an interesting place. But...we're in Paris for a couple days and I think I'll throw a Paris post in for the heck of it. This will be just kind of freeform, mostly pictures.
<h2>Quiet Streets</h2>
For some reason, the walk today took us on a number of quiet streets. Paris is a <em>big </em>city and like all big cities, noisy. But these streets are all in popular parts of Paris, they all connect main streets and yet, well, look at the pictures.

<h2>Some stores we liked:</h2>
[gallery link="files" size="medium" columns="2" ids="1549,1548,1540,1539,1544"]

<h2>Seine Walks</h2>
I've talked before about how Paris has opened up the Seine river banks to pedestrians. Here's some pictures of another area. This one is almost a mile long.
[gallery link="files" size="medium"  columns="2" ids="1554,1553,1552"]

<h2>Rodin's Garden</h2>
We ended by having lunch at the cafeteria in Rodin's garden. It's not the greatest food, but the setting: in a beautiful garden with Rodin sculptures around. Fabulous.
[gallery  link="files" size="medium" columns="2" ids="1565,1550,1551"]

<h2>Palais Garnier</h2>
<em>Palais Garnier</em> is the smaller of Paris's two opera houses and <em>definitely</em> the over-the-top one. It was built on the commission of Napoleon III, who was Emperor of France (taking after his uncle) from 1852 to 1870. Napoleon III was a lousy emperor, but a great city-builder; Paris today is largely the result of his efforts, as carried out by Baron Von Haussmann and others. Charles Garnier got the commission to develop this opera house. Although an architectural upstart at the time, this building made his reputation and career.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, phew! I finally got my pictures of Bourges ready for a post. Hard work, you know!

Bourges is a mid-sized city about two hours south of us. For tourists, its attractions are a beautiful, HUGE Gothic cathedral, and many medieval buildings that have been preserved, or restored to medieval condition, making it a great walking-around town. It also was the home-base of Jacques Coeur, who must be the most unknown powerful man ever. No one knows of him, but in the mid-1400s, he and his companies were essentially <em>the </em>French economy. Jacques Coeur had - and exercised - the power that the King of France could only wish he had.

Jacques Coeur built a beautiful Gothic house in Bourges. It remains the biggest and best example of Gothic architecture in a private residence. It's thought that he never actually lived here, though his long-suffering wife and kids did while he was off gallivanting around the world on his commercial and diplomatic missions.

[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1600,1599,1598, 1615"]

The front of the house also has what are thought to be busts of Jacques Coeur and his wife. These are on either side of the front door of the house. Maybe they weren't getting along at the time...
[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1611,1596"]

Because Jacques Coeur made much of his considerable fortune in shipping, his house pays honor to his ships in a number of places.

<h3>Bourges Cathedral</h3>

<h3>Some pictures from Bourges</h3>
[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1603,1602,1606,1607,1601,1595"]

Bourges - another city we would return to visit in a minute. We're never going to see all France, because we keep finding these places to which we want to return, which means we don't have time for new places. Such a dilemma...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The weather has turned hot again - mid-80s today; we're keeping the strenuous activity to a minimum and to the morning. This morning we returned to an area near us that is designated as a nature preserve: the Plaine of Sorque.

Once, this area was mostly stone quarries. A particularly beautiful sandstone was quarried here until the 1960s from open-air pits. But evidently sandstone fell out of favor, or the supply was used up because in the 1950s and 1960s, the quarries closed, leaving large holes in the ground, which quickly filled with water.

Someone decided that these lakes could form the central part of a great bird preserve, so the land around them was allowed to return to its native state. Trails were created, and two observation platforms, with camouflage and holes to look out and use for cameras, were built on the shore of the largest lake. The trail goes along the Loing River for quite a ways, too. It is really a beautiful place to visit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You may recall from my earlier post that we <em>loved</em> La Rochelle. So much so that we returned last week for another stay, three days this time. I am glad to report that we still love La Rochelle.

One thing about La Rochelle is that its main purpose for existing is to serve seafood to as many people as possible. And I mean great seafood - always fresh.

Now, Friday was Laurie's birthday and we <em>had</em> to celebrate. It's not everyday that one celebrates his or her 40th birthday, and I can tell you that Laurie didn't celebrate her 40th that day either. Anywhooo, I had to find a special place for a birthday dinner, a place with that certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>, the greatest in a city of great restaurants. I looked, I researched, I checked them out, and finally, I found it:

[caption id="attachment_1644" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04037.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1644" alt="Le P'tit Bleu - nothing but the best." src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04037.jpg" width="576" height="324" /></a> Le P'tit Bleu - nothing but the best.[/caption]

You can see that the "dining room" of <em>Le P'tit Bleu</em> is a bunch of tables along side the old harbor.

Now, you may be laughing (or crying) but I'll tell you that the moules (mussels) we had there were fantastic; they are cooked on a grill while you wait and served up too hot to eat for a few minutes. Here's Laurie tucking in:

[caption id="attachment_1645" align="aligncenter" width="351"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04031.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1645" alt="Moules - Mmmmmmmm." src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04031.jpg" width="351" height="576" /></a> Moules - Mmmmmmmm.[/caption]

Here's a picture of the view. The tower in the background was built in the 1400s.

[caption id="attachment_1646" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04034.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1646" alt="View at dinner." src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04034.jpg" width="576" height="324" /></a> View at dinner.[/caption]

Le P'tit Bleu is not the only restaurant in La Rochelle; there must be <em>hundreds</em> of them. This is truly a city dedicated to seafood.

Some more La Rochelle pictures. I didn't take so many this trip, as I took <em>hundreds</em> last time we were here.

[caption id="attachment_1651" align="aligncenter" width="324"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04056.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1651" alt="The sign on this wine store says &quot;Supplier to the Navy.&quot; Hmmmm...." src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC04056.jpg" width="324" height="576" /></a> The sign on this wine store says "Supplier to the Navy." Hmmmm....[/caption]

So we still do love this city and, honestly, can't imagine coming to France without a detour down to La Rochelle. Want to see more La Rochelle pix? Check out the <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=769" title="La Rochelle">La Rochelle</a> post from July. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Rance...I mean, Reims]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We spent three days last week with Mary and Gilles on a ramble that centered on the town of Reims. The reason for the funny title is that the French pronounce Reims as "Rance." I don't know why; an example of the crazy French language. I should point out that I live in the Northwest part of the U.S., where Sequim is pronounced "skwim" and Yachats is pronounced "ya-hots" and Puyallup is pronounced a dozen different ways, so I don't think the French have anything on us in the pronunciation arena.

Anyway, Reims was a fascinating place. It is the biggest city by far in the Champagne region, and has become a rich city on champagne. During World War I ("the Great War" or "The War to End All Wars" but more accurately "The War That Made World War II Inevitable"), Reims was just a few miles from the German/Allied front lines. The German army bombarded Reims every day for four years, leaving over 80% of the city's buildings uninhabitable when the armistice was signed. This means that there are few really old buildings in Reims, though the Cathedral survived with major damage and has been restored to its original appearance.

For us, Reims falls into a category we've assigned many places to: "Cities We Want to See Again."
<h2>World War I Museum</h2>
This area of France was the front of World War I for almost four years. Most towns and cities were devastated by the war. In Meaux (pronounced "Mo," as you expected), France has created a beautiful museum dedicated to WW I. It's pretty powerful.

[gallery size="medium" link="files" columns="2" ids="1723,1721,1722,1720"]
<h2>Reims</h2>
We bought a package at the Office of Tourisme that included an audio guide with two walking tours and a visit to one of the champagne houses situated in Reims. First tour: the Reims Cathedral.
<h2>Reims Cathedral</h2>
All French kings, starting with Clovis in 496, were crowned at the site of the Reims Cathedral. The cathedral itself was built in the 1200s, when Gothic was the style and so this cathedral is pure Gothic. It is really known for its stained-glass windows.

The cathedral was less than five miles from the German front during World War I; saying that its towers could be used by French troops for observing German activity, the Germans shelled the Cathedral nearly every day for four years. The structure remained (a testimony to the strength of Gothic architecture), but the roof was gone, much of the stained-glass destroyed (some had been removed for safe-keeping) and both the interior and exterior were badly damaged. Restoration started immediately after the war and today the Cathedral is much as it was pre-war, with the exception of some new stained-glass windows.

<h2>Art Deco in Reims</h2>
World War I devastated Reims. Like the cathedral, German guns shelled and German planes bombed the city nearly every day for four years. At war's end, 83% of the city's buildings were uninhabitable. The city was rebuilt almost completely, and quickly.

Now this rebuilding had a benefit for those of us who like and appreciate Art Deco and Art Nouveau buildings. Because these styles were still popular post-WW I, many of the new and rebuilt buildings in Reims have touches of these styles. Our second walking tour was to see some of these buildings.

<h3> Other Art Deco</h3>

<h2>Taittinger</h2>
Our audio guide purchase included a visit at a Champagne house. We chose Taittinger, a premium producer. The tour included a walk-through of the cellars and a taste of their champagne, which was <em>very</em> nice indeed.

Many champagne producers chose Reims as their headquarters for production because, before champagne came along, the city had provided tons and tons of sandstone for buildings throughout France. That meant miles of caves, all at a constant temperature (53F/12C) and humidity. The tour went 120 feet below ground into the <em>caves. </em>This particular cave, about a third the size of Taittinger's main <em>cave</em> a mile away, holds about 3 million bottles of champagne. The region produces some 350 million bottles per year. That's a lot of bubbly.

That's it for Reims. As I said at the beginning, it's another city we want to re-visit; I think we saw about one-quarter of the interesting sights here.

And, by the way, we had fabulous meals here. At an Italian restaurant, canneloni stuffed with shredded duck. A lamb dish that was among the best ever. We'd come back for the restaurants.]]></content:encoded>

Last weekend we took off with Laurie's sister Peggy to see some chateaux in the Loire Valley (had a great time; pictures soon).

I promise I'll get some pictures up soon.

Can't believe it: we'll be back in Seattle two weeks from yesterday.]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Loire Valley Chateaux]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've got some catching up to do here! We spent three days in the Loire Valley with Laurie's sister Peggy, then Craig and Annie and Clara (aka, "The Red Tomato") arrived and we culminated that visit with a birthday party to celebrate Clara's third birthday. I'll start with the Loire Valley visit.

I read somewhere that there are over 1,200 registered chateaux in the Loire Valley, which makes visiting all of them problematical. So we narrowed it to three - the same three Laurie and I visited about eight or ten years ago on a ramble with Mary and Gilles. One has the best gardens, one is almost unanimously hailed as the most beautiful and the third is one that we just like - maybe not the best known, but a favorite for us.
<h2>Villandry</h2>
Chateau Villandry is known for its gardens. There's a chateau, of course, and it's possible to tour it, of course, but the gardens are the stars here.
[gallery size="large" link="files" columns="1" ids="1759,1761,1762"]
<h2>Chenonceau</h2>
The first time we went to Chenonceau, some ten years ago, I was prepared to dislike it. <em>Every</em> guidebook says that Chateau Chenonceau is the most beautiful chateau in France, and so I was going to be an iconoclast and dislike it just on general principle. Unfortunately, my plans fell apart when I saw it. Chenonceau likely is, indeed, the most beautiful chateau in France (I haven't seen even 2% of all the chateaux, so I can't really say for sure), and it is surely one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen. Some pictures:
[gallery size="large" link="files" columns="1" ids="1763,1764,1766,1765,1768"]
Of course, I can't post without a little history. The chateau went through a series of builds and rebuilds until 1535 when king Francis I seized it as a repayment for debts from its then-owner. In 1547, Henri II gave it to his mistress Diane de Poitier, who built the arched bridge across the river and extensive gardens. When Henri II was killed in 1559, his queen, Catherine de Medicis, immediately evicted Diane and took over Chenonceau. She had built the beautiful building on the bridge across the river, and Chenonceau became her favorite place and her home. From Chenonceau she ruled France, first as regent for her son Francis II (married to Mary, Queen of Scots), then Charles IX and finally Henri III, all of whom bowed to her power even though they were kings. After Catherine died, the chateau passed through several owners, each of whom stripped it of more of its valuable paintings, statues and furniture, until it was bought in 1733 in a dilapidated and empty condition by a wealthy squire, Claude Dupin. Although he was seldom there, his wife, Madam Louise Dupin, restored Chenonceau to its glory.
<h2>Azay-le-Rideau</h2>
The Chateau Azay-le-Rideau is a perfect Renaissance chateau. Although it's less-known than most Loire Valley chateaux, Laurie and I may like it best. It's small, amazingly beautiful, easy to visit and tour, has been a residence since the early 1500s and has rooms furnished as they would have been throughout its history. We love the place. We visited early in the morning and found it almost deserted, adding to its charm.
[gallery size="large" link="files" columns="1" ids="1771,1770,1769"]
<h2>Abbaye de Fontevraud</h2>
This abbey has a rather long history: it was founded in the 1100s by a Duke of Aquitaine and has been associated with Aquitaine rulers ever since. At that time Aquitaine (the entire southwest quarter of todays France) was an independent entity, not part of France as it exists today. When Eleanor of Aquitaine, who ruled Aquitaine in the 12th century, divorced the French king Louis VII and married the future king of England, Henry II, all the lands she controlled became English property and the seeds of the Hundred Years War were sown.

Eleanor, who was one of the most powerful woman Europe has known, supported Abbaye de Fontevraud and went there to live in 1200. She died four years later and was buried there with her husband Henry II and her son Richard Lionheart, also a king of England.

In 1803, after the French Revolution stripped the Abbaye of all power and religious meaning, it was converted into a prison. Really! For 180 years it was about the most feared prison in France. Then in 1983 the prison was closed, most of the prison buildings were torn down and a long restoration commenced. Today the Abbaye de Fontevraud is one of the most complete and beautiful Romanesque complexes in France.

[gallery size="large" link="files" columns="1" ids="1773,1774,1783,1784,1772"]
That's our Loire Valley ramble. It was very good to see places we'd seen ten years ago and enjoy them every bit as much. In fact, we may have enjoyed them more this time, as we have learned lots of French history in the intervening years, which gave us a better understanding of these places and their history.

It was also great fun to show Peggy these places. Her enthusiasm - her almost constant comment was "Oh, my God, is that beautiful or what?" - was great fun for Laurie and I, and made us enjoy these sites even more.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, the Berlin Zumstegs descended on Montigny-sur-Loing. We were <em>sooooooo</em> glad to have them here and <em>sooooooo </em>sad to see them leave. Rather than a long, detailed and boring account of what we did, here are some pictures, mostly of Clara.

[gallery size="large" link="files" columns="1" ids="1809,1807,1808,1806,1804,1801,1803,1798,1795, 1822,1797,1799,1800,1796,1810"]
<h2>Birthday Princess</h2>
Clara's third birthday was Sepember 20, so we celebrated while she was here. She didn't seem to mind having another party.

[gallery size="large" link="files" columns="1" ids="1823,1825,1826,1827,1828,1832,1830,1829,1833,1834,1835, 1847"]

<h2>Winding Down</h2>
Craig and Annie and Clara left Sunday; Monday we went to Paris for a couple nights. Now we're back in Montigny-sur-Loing, our home for almost five months. Sunday we'll shut the house up and return the keys and go to <em>chez Germain</em>; Monday the car goes back to Renault; Tuesday we return to Seattle.

It has been a great adventure, from start to finish, and while we'll be glad to return home, we will equally be sad to leave France. I'll likely post another "wrap-up" commentary soon, but I think this is the last newsy post. Sigh...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The trip home yesterday was uneventful. Our worry (and it wasn't much of a worry) was that the officer at Charles DeGaulle Passport Control would notice that we had stayed 145 days on a 90-day visa. In the event, the officer opened our passports, found an empty page, and stamped it with the exit stamp. He didn't look for the entry visa or anything. We could have been in France for a year - two years! - as far as he was concerned. Wish we had been...

We also learned what happens to unoccupied houses:
<ul>
	<li>The Prius wouldn't start because of a dead battery; the Rav4 turned over slowly, but it did start.</li>
	<li>I'd turned off the water heater and it wouldn't turn back on. Now, after a 20-hour trip, there is <em>nothing</em> we wanted more than a shower, but 'twas not to be.</li>
	<li>Two circuits had flipped their breakers. No idea why, but it meant the wireless phone was not charged.</li>
	<li>Internet and phone service had not started as scheduled.</li>
	<li>Cellphone service had not started as scheduled.</li>
	<li>The local water district says we used a huge amount of water in the first half of August and would like $850, please. That battle is not done.</li>
	<li>The yard is green but looks like a jungle! It's going to take weeks to get it back under control.</li>
</ul>
So that's what greeted us last night. We ignored most of it and went to bed. This morning our friend Margaret left a breakfast casserole, so we had a hot meal (thank you, Margaret!); a couple phone calls got Internet and cellphones working again; another call got a hot water heater service call, so we had hot water by 11 this morning; the lawns got mowed and I started on the overgrown plants; the cars got charged and are working fine. So we're good.

But geeze, mentally and emotionally, we are still in France. I think it will be a long time before that fades. I found myself today responding with "Ah, voilà" to lots of stuff, just like you hear all the time in France.

I'll post a summary of our best memories and impressions in the next days. For now, I can only say that everyone should do something like this. We loved darn near every minute of the 145 days we were in France, and it ain't gonna be easy to let that go.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, it's back to France, for another extended stay!

We loved our 2013 France sojourn so much that we're going to do it again this year. Not quite as long as 2013, but close:

May 11 - Seattle to New York, for a visit with Craig, Annie and Clara
May 14 - New York to Paris
Four-and-a-half months in France.
Sept 28 - Paris to New York for a visit with Craig, Annie, Clara and Clara's new brother, who will have been born mid-August
October 3 - back to Seattle

(Yes, that's correct: Laurie and I are going to be grandparents again. We are SOOOO excited about that!)

For some details...

First, I am excited that we fly from New York's JFK airport to Paris on an Air France Airbus A380, the biggest passenger airplane ever built. I think both readers of this blog know that I love airplanes - passenger airplanes, in particular - and I've wanted to fly on this beast since it entered service in 2007. Here's a picture:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A380-800-e1424463355317.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1915" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A380-800-e1424463355317.png" alt="A380-800" width="781" height="353" /></a>

Laurie and I will be sitting on the upper-deck, at the window just in front of the last door opening. Yeah, it's just plain old Economy Class (when you're paying for the tickets because you don't have enough frequent flier miles to get in Business Class, you fly Economy Class), but we understand these seats have a couple more inches of leg room (good for me) and are in a row of only two seats (good for Laurie, as she doesn't have to fight for the armrest with some stranger sitting next to her or have that stranger fall asleep with his head on her shoulder - yes, that has happened).

We really lucked out on places to stay this time. In 2013, we rented a house in the small town of Montigny-sur-Loing. That worked just great, but this time it's even better. Last year, when we started talking about doing another long trip, I emailed our friends there and asked them to keep an eye open for a place to stay nearer them. Almost immediately, Jamie Rufin (of Jamie and Hervé; you read of them in our last trip blog and certainly will again this trip) wrote that their friends/neighbors leave their house each summer to go to a summer house in the Alps and they would be glad to have us "house-sit;" we leapt on that opportunity. Then, with a little digging around on Airbnb I found a house in the town Mary and Gilles Germain live in. I asked Jamie and Mary if they knew anything about it and it turns out the owner is good friends with both of them! I contacted her and rented her cottage for five weeks. So those take care of June, July and August, and we figure we can find things to do for the last half of May and most of September.

We're leasing the same kind of car - a Renault Clio - from the same company - Renault Eurodrive - this year. (Renault Eurodrive has offices in Elmsford, NY; six months ago I couldn't have told you where in the world Elmsford was  - it's about 30 miles northwest of Manhattan, a small town with a population of about 5,000 - but in August, Craig and Annie and Clara moved to...Elmsford!) We love the Clio: it's sporty, has a lot of get-up-and-go, looks good with plenty of space for the two of us, and in 2013 we got just a touch under 50 mpg for the entire time we were there. Fuel prices have declined in France as they have here, but diesel is still $5.25 per gallon (it was over $7 per gallon two years ago), so 50 mpg, we're good with that.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-167" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_44851.jpg" alt="IMG_4485.jpg" width="600" height="400" />

So we're off again. We cannot wait to get back to France. It really feels like our home-away-from home, until we try to ask a question in a store; then...not so much.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are in France! Not only that, we are well-rested, having had a full night's sleep last night (assisted slightly by a little chemical magic) and ensconced in <em>chez Germain</em>, Mary and Gilles beautiful house.

<span style="color: #000000;"><b>The Plane, the Plane!</b></span>

First, understand that I like the planes of Seattle's home-town airplane builder and I've always chosen to fly Boeing planes when I had a choice. After flying the Airbus A380, though, I have to say that on a long-haul flight it's my airplane of choice.

Here is our plane arriving at JFK:

[caption id="attachment_1962" align="aligncenter" width="1618"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-blog-5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-blog-5.jpg" alt="Airbus A380" width="1618" height="618" /></a> Air France Airbus A380 arriving at JFK[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_1963" align="aligncenter" width="1353"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-blog-6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1963" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-blog-6.jpg" alt="Yes, it does look like a whale from the front." width="1353" height="738" /></a> Yes, it does look like a whale from the front.[/caption]

Inside, really, it's not much different than any other airplane: lots of seats crowded together. This plane is three and a half years old, so everything was still pretty fresh and clean. The only indicator that you're on a BIG airplane is looking outside and seeing the ground crew waaaaay down below.

We sat in the back on the upper-deck, in a row that has only two seats. We paid extra for that privilege, because we'd read that these rows have some extra leg-room (not true) and because it's nice not having to crawl over a third person to get in and out, or to share the armrest and space (true).

We'd heard that on the upper deck, the noise level is the same as any other airplane; on the lower deck, it is said to be much quieter, since there's no wind noise above. That's likely true, but I can tell you that Laurie and I were immediately impressed at how quiet it was at our seats way in the back (which is usually noisier than anywhere else on the plane) and on the upper deck. We carried on a conversation at lower-than-normal voice levels <em>as the plane was taking off and climbing out!</em> Throughout the flight, the noise level seemed to us to be way lower than on any other plane we've been on lately. I took some sound level measurements and will compare them to our remaining flights on this trip.

A funny note: at home we've become fans of a French wine named "La Vieille Ferme" (the Old Farm); we think it's one of the best bargains in wine: about $7/bottle at Total Wines, and a very nice wine, worth much more than that, in our always-humble opinions. So we got a great laugh when we saw what wine we would be served with our dinner:

[caption id="attachment_1965" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04631.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04631.jpg" alt="Only the best wines on Air France..." width="400" /></a> Only the best wines on Air France...[/caption]

Overall, we are totally impressed by this airplane, and will go out of our way to fly it on long flights.

A historical side-note: in the mid-1980s, Boeing and Airbus conducted a joint study to determine if they should build an A380-size airplane together. Boeing declined to participate and Airbus decided to build it anyway. Whether that was a good decision on either manufacturer's part remains to be seen, but with flagging A380 sales and the success of Boeing's 777 and 787, it looks as if Boeing was right. Airlines seem to really like those two airplanes, which have the range of a 747 or A380, but make money with fewer passengers. (Big planes just aren't so attractive right now: Airbus sold zero A380s last year, and Boeing has sold only 122 747-8s so far, 71 of which are freighters and six of which are VIP Business Jets!)

Count us as fans of the Airbus A380!

<strong>Arrival</strong>

Mary had arranged a driver for us at the airport and we were <em>very</em> glad to see him as we exited baggage claim. It's about a 90-minute drive to Boi-le-Rois, site of <em>chez Germain</em>; Gilles has, in the past, picked us up, but they're in the States now, so taxi it was. (The taxi was a BMW station wagon - very nice.) When we arrived, Mary's friend and neighbor Valerie was waiting at the house to give us keys, and show us the tricks of the new house. She had brought us fresh croissants, a baguette, bread and jam. Now if there's a better way to start a France visit than with croissants, we don't know it. We devoured the croissants, unpacked, napped, opened a bottle of wine (thank you, Gilles!), had a simple dinner, took a walk along the Seine and fell into bed. Glad - very glad - to be back in France.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're in Bois-le-Roi (Forest of the King). This town of 5,500 people is about 35 minutes by train south of Paris, and is where our friends Mary and Gilles live; we're staying at their house for a few days, until they kick us out.

Bois-le-Roi is an old village: Wikipedia says the town was first mentioned in documents in 1260. The king of the name was Saint Louis, who reigned from 1226 to 1270.

A most interesting aspect of Bois-le-Roi is that during the Belle Epoque (the Beautiful Age, generally the late 1800s until the start of World War I), a number of beautiful summer houses were built along the banks of the Seine in Bois-le-Roi. These houses are called <em>affolantes,</em> which translates in this sense as something along the lines of "craziness," reflecting that these houses of the Belle Epoque ultra-rich were just crazy...and they are. Here are the best of <em>les affolantes</em> in Bois-le-Roi.

The building below has an interesting history: built in the late 1800s in a town north of Paris, it burned around the turn of the century. The facade and some of the rest of the house did not burn, and the untouched parts were taken apart, transported to the site on which they now sit, and reconstructed while the rest of the house was built around them.

Nice houses, but I suspect they are nightmares to maintain. Many have large, beautiful gardens and all have views over the river.

Late today, we're off to Paris for a couple days. The weather is supposed to be good (since we arrived last Friday, the forecast has predicted rain every day and yesterday it finally rained a bit after five days of sunshine - though it's been cold). We are looking forward to seeing our favorite city.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have a bunch of books of Paris walks, because Paris is definitely a city that rewards walkers. Heck, there's even a French word for a person who just strolls in the city: <em>flaneur.</em> That's us, a pair of <em>flaneurs</em> in our favorite city.

Paris also rewards looking up. This city has thousands of beautiful buildings, from every era. We have become aficionados of architecture here, so the book "Architecture of Paris" by the architect and architectural historian Noval White is going to become a favorite. It contains 58 walks, in all parts of Paris, and points out every interesting building on the walk - the good, the bad, the beautiful and the ugly (and yes, there are some really ugly buildings here). We took our first Norval White walk yesterday and, even though we got through only a third of it - in two hours! - the walk took us to many things we otherwise never would have seen.

Now, the starting point of our walk is not likely to receive visits from tourists and, in fact, not much more likely to see Parisians. Here, the city of Paris raises all the plants and flowers that are used throughout the city. It also has a huge glass greenhouse containing many different types of palm trees and other tropical plants. In this huge garden - probably fifty acres of so - we saw one jogger, two mothers with strollers, and one other person.
<h2>Ville de Paris Establissement Horticultural</h2>

<h2>Modern Architecture in Paris</h2>
The walk then took us through the neighborhood of Boulogne. Now, most Paris visitors know of and have visited the Bois de Boulogne - the huge park at the west side of the city. The neighborhood of Bolougne is quite an interesting area: definitely up-scale, and the site of many of the best modernist buildings in Paris. In the 1920s and 1930s a number of modernist architects built here and so it's possible to see the works of many architects in a relatively small area. Among these architects were the foremost of the modernist movement: Le Corbusier, Mallet-Stevens, Raymond Fischer, George-Henri Pingussson.

I thought that modern architecture in this city of old and beautiful buildings would be ugly, but I was wrong. In this area, which has many traditional and modern buildings, the modern buildings fit in well. I guess that beautiful buildings are beautiful, no matter where they are.

Some highlights:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04767.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2015" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04767.jpg" alt="DSC04767" width="432" height="576" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04760.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2014" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04760.jpg" alt="DSC04760" width="419" height="576" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04758.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2013" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04758.jpg" alt="DSC04758" width="432" height="576" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04751.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2010" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04751.jpg" alt="DSC04751" width="768" height="576" /></a>
Conversely, an ugly building is an ugly building no matter where it is. This one is a miss - and a mess:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04756.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2012" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04756.jpg" alt="DSC04756" width="432" height="576" /></a>Later in the day, after a rest and a bit of vino, we walked to a church nearby. This church is modeled after Hagia Sofia in Istanbul, and is way different than any other church we've seen in Paris or anywhere. It's a huge space inside, with a huge dome, as in Hagia Sofia. My photographic skills aren't up to conveying the sense of Eglise de Saint-Espiritu, but here's a picture looking up into the dome.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04775.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2016" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04775.jpg" alt="DSC04775" width="432" height="576" /></a>And last, the front window of a store that repair sewing machines. Like the bookbinder, there can't be much call for the services offered here, but it survives, and we loved the window:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04778.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2017" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04778.jpg" alt="DSC04778" width="768" height="576" /></a>We were whupped after this day. Dinner, another glass of wine, and sleep.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Saturday Gilles was set to watch an important Rugby match of his favorite team, from his hometown area of Clermont-Ferrand. Knowing that it would be a really good idea for us to be absent during the match, Mary, Laurie and I set off for Égreville, to see some beautiful countryside and to visit a garden of sculptures by Antoine Bourdelle.

Antoine Bourdelle worked in Paris in the late 1800s and early 1900s, until his death in 1929. He seems well known here, but I don't think I'd heard of him before; but then, I am not well-versed in the world of sculpture, so my ignorance isn't any reflection on Bourdelle's place in the art world.

Anyway, when he died, his daughter and son-in-law, who lived in the small town of Égreville, about an hour south of Paris, created a beautiful garden with 56 of his sculptures and bas-reliefs. It really is a beautiful and peaceful place and it was a perfect afternoon outing for us.

Laurie liked this sculpture of the famous dancer Isador Duncan best. It's small - about 3 feet high -  but we still couldn't fit it into the car.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Warning: airplane geekiness ahead. If airplanes hold no interest for you, you might just want to skip this post.</h3>
Two years ago I went to the Paris Air Show - the biggest in the world. This year, Hervé Rufin invited me to a smaller airshow at the grass strip in the town of La Ferté Alais. Yesterday we - Hervé, his daughter Sophia and me - went, and had a ball. But then, we're airplane geeks, so you know we're going to have a good time.

This is an amazing airshow in a way completely different from the Paris Air Show. That one is industry-oriented, with thousands of exhibitors and mostly modern airplanes. (For more, look at this blog entry: <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=561">Paris Air Show, 2013</a>)

The La Ferté Alais airshow has mostly historic airplanes, all of which are living, breathing, <em>flying</em> airplanes.  There were planes from the 1910s and 1920s; when I saw them I thought they were static displays, that is, non-flying replicas. Nope, they were the real thing: every one of these planes flew during the show.

This is a replica built from the original plans. This airplane type flew first in 1912.[/caption]

In the US of A we forget that after Wilbur and Orville Wright first flew a heavier-than-air machine in 1903, they had little success getting anyone in the United States interested in the potential of airplanes. In 1908 they came to France with their latest airplane and spent almost a year working with French people who did understand the value and future of airplanes. When the Wright Brothers returned to the States in 1909, the French aviation industry thrived and for quite a few years, creating the most advance airplanes in the world. Many of those pioneering airplanes were at La Ferté Alais airshow, and showed their stuff by flying.
<h3>An Old Friend: The North American T28.</h3>
Long ago I went through Navy flight training at Pensacola Florida and there flew the T28, built by North American Aviation, in Primary Flight Training. So it was with pleasure that I saw the French version of that plane at La Ferté Alais. Even better that Hervé knew a person who happened to be at the T28 display, told him that I'd flown this type and that fellow introduced me to the owner. After swapping a story or two, he asked if I'd like to climb up and look inside. Yes, indeed, I did.

That's the first time I've looked into the cockpit of a T28 in 45 years, but I recognized everything in it. Definitely a blast from the past.

Hervé, Sophia and had a great time, and I am grateful to Hervé for the invitation and the fun we had.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[French has a phrase for a geographical area so small that it may not even be inhabited: <i>lieu-dit. </i>Driving on back roads of France you'll see hundreds of signs for <i>lieux-dits, </i>places that might have a house or two, or might just be a place that was given a name centuries ago that the local inhabitants have kept alive. The last couple days we stayed in such a place: <em>Les Fromions</em>. There is, of course, a story...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC05002_20150527.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2072 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC05002_20150527-1024x768.jpg" alt="DSC05002_20150527" width="640" height="480" /></a>

You'll remember that the day we arrived - almost two weeks ago - we were met at Mary &amp; Gilles' house by their neighbor and good friend Valerie Appell. She showed us the house, left us food and invited us to lunch the following day; quite a nice introduction to France. At lunch Valerie's husband Yves served a Sancerre red wine and we mentioned how much we love the wines of Sancerre.

Valerie and Yves then told us about their family house near Sancerre and, as they were going to be there this week, invited us and Mary &amp; Gilles for a night. So - voilà  - we spent Tuesday roaming the region of Sancerre, eating the Chavignol cheese for which the area is also famous, trying and buying Sancerre wine, and then arriving at the bustling <em>lieu-dit</em> of <em>Les Fromions:</em>

[caption id="attachment_2063" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04905_20150526.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2063 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC04905_20150526-1024x768.jpg" alt="Les Fromions, in total." width="640" height="480" /></a> Les Fromions, in total.[/caption]

Yep, that's it. The closest house is Valerie and Yves, the one to the left of it is the house of Yves aunt, and in the third house is a non-Appell family man.

Now, to say that <em>Les Fromions</em> is peaceful and beautiful understates the situation. Here's the view on the other side of the house:

No neighbors, no highways, no planes overhead, no trains roaring by. Just beautiful, quiet French countryside.

To work up a dinner appetite, we took a walk.

After an aperitif, a fabulous dinner, and Valerie's world-famous tiramisu, we slept like logs - in that quiet how could we not? The next morning we did another long walk, visited a beautiful garden and went to the nearest town for lunch in the <i>Tabac</i>.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC05012_20150527.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2073" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DSC05012_20150527-1024x540.jpg" alt="&quot;Lunch" /></a>

Then, it was time to go. As we loaded up the car, Yves prepared for a hard afternoon of recovering from our visit.

Did we have a nice time? Hoo-hah, did we ever. We are so grateful to Valerie and Yves for inviting us and opening their Sancerre home to us, treating us with such hospitality. This is a <i>lieu-dit</i> we love.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[France has a lot of <em>châteaux</em> - a <strong>LOT</strong> of <em>châteaux</em>. Although the best known are in the Loire Valley, there are beautiful <em>châteaux</em> everywhere around us; yesterday we visited Courances, a Renaissance <em>château</em> best known for its beautiful water garden park.

[caption id="attachment_2106" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20150530_DSC05077.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2106" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20150530_DSC05077-1024x768.jpg" alt="View as you approach the front of Courances château." width="640" height="480" /></a> View as you approach the front of Courances château.[/caption]

This <em>château</em> has quite a history. The Gallard family took over the property (175 acres, with a rustic house on it) in 1622 and soon had the <em>château</em> built and the gardens started. However, the family was trying to impress people with how much money it had by building and running both Courances and a <em>hotel particulier </em>(a huge private mansion) in Paris and went bankrupt doing it; evidently they didn't have quite enough money. The <em>château</em> then was auctioned off to a junior line of the family and, through a marriage, came to the Nicolay family in the mid-1700s. The Nicolays made more changes to the garden, but lost Courances (and their heads) in the French Revolution (1789-1795). The remaining Nicolay fled and, in 1830, gave up trying to maintain the <em>château</em> from exile.

Courances sat empty and the park untended for the next 40 years. In 1872, Baron de Haber bought it and started rehabbing it. At that time it was a mess - there was even a tree growing in the dining room. The good Baron wanted the château to solidify his standing as a French aristocrat; he was a German banker but an aristocrat wanna-be. His descendents still live in it.

Throughout its history, owners have spent a huge amount of time and money on the garden. A <i>lot</i> of money. The Baron was no exception; under his management the entire <em>château</em> and park were completely renovated from their untended-for-forty-years condition to what we see today. I might point out that his family lives here only sometimes, splitting its time between the five or six <em>other </em>châteaux they own and their <em>hotel particulier </em>(translated: huge private mansion) in Paris.

The water garden of Courances sets it above many other <em>château</em> in France; the house itself is beautiful but not extraordinary. The gardens, with many ponds and lakes and canals created by the many owners over a period of five centuries, are extraordinary, as you can see:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We came back to Paris this week, as the weather here was forecast to be excellent. It has been that; in fact, too excellent, as the temperature is forecast to be 90 or higher today (Friday). That's just a bit too much; I do okay in such hot weather, but Laurie wilts, and even for me, it's not so enjoyable. "Strong storms" are forecast for this afternoon, so we'll probably head back to Bois-le-Roi a day earlier than we'd planned. But we got in a great two days of rambling around and here's a (longish) report on them. I'll include lots of pictures - you can double-click any of them to get a full-size picture.

<strong>Some Paris Architecture - New and Old
</strong>
Paris has maybe the most diverse architecture of any city in the world. Because Paris has never been seriously bombed or attacked over its history, there are buildings here from the 14th century to today. Many are beautiful and some...not so much. Thursday we saw a brand-new addition to Paris, and we think it is spectacular.
<h3>A Ramble Around Bassin Villette</h3>
La Villette is an old working section of Paris, in the north part of the city. Bassin Villette is the north end of Canal Saint-Martin, where it becomes Canal Ourcq and Canal Saint-Denis splits off. Laurie and I took a walk from our book of architectural walks in Paris, and saw some cool stuff. Here are some pictures:

<h3 class="alignnone">Habitation de Bon Marché (HBM)<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150603_DSC05172.jpg">
</a></h3>
<p class="alignnone">Years ago - heck, <em>centuries</em> ago - France decided that all people should have good housing. As a result, the county has built lots of low-income housing and workers' housing. We encountered this block of workers' housing on our walk. Built in the early 1920s, it still is some sort of low-income or subsidized housing. It is very nice and beautifully kept up.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150603_DSC05172.jpg">
</a></p>

<p class="alignnone"><a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150603_DSC05175.jpg">
</a>But not all Paris buildings are so beautiful. This is a brand-new government building. I shudder to think what might have been torn down to make room for this monstrosity.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150603_DSC05189.jpg">
</a></p>

<h3 class="alignnone">Louis Vuitton Foundation Building, Bois-de-Bologne</h3>
Frank Gehry is arguably the most innovative architect today, and inarguably the best known. We were introduced to his work some years ago when we visited Bilbao, Spain to see the Guggenheim Museum he designed there; we returned a couple years later to see it again. For me, it's the most beautiful building I've seen - just amazing. On the other hand, Gehry designed Seattle's Experience Music Project building (for Paul Allen, of Microsoft fame) which the New York Times' architecture critic described as "something that crawled out of Puget Sound and died." He was, in my always-humble opinion, being charitable; I think the EMP building is atrocious. (Even Gehry has expressed reservations about it.) Gehry has designed so many fabulous buildings that we were excited to see what he'd done for the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris; the building has received rave reviews and, as soon as we caught a glimpse of it, we joined the raving crowd. This is a spectacular building.

[gallery size="medium" columns="2" ids="2142,2143,2144,2145,2146,2141,2147,2149"]

Any day there will be piq-niques along the Seine, but on a hot day - it was over 80 today - things really liven up. Imagine what this will be like Friday night, when the temps exceeded 90F.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150604_DSC05255.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2152" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150604_DSC05255-1024x768.jpg" alt="20150604_DSC05255" width="640" height="480" /></a>
We loved the entrepreneur spirit of the guys who were going among this crowd selling wine and beer. They probably didn't sell much, as almost everyone had brought plenty of their own.

We also went to Chateau Vincennes this morning, but I'm tired of writing and I suspect you're tired of reading. Tomorrow for that post.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Laurie says lots of blog readers will be interested in seeing where we're staying for five weeks. I'm not so sure, but here goes...

I think an unsettling moment of traveling is when you arrive at a place - a hotel, a B &amp; B, a rental, whatever - that you've seen only in pictures and you open the door. What, exactly, are you going to discover? We've seen plenty of places that looked oh-so-good on a website but were not-so-good when the door opened. Our cottage here in Bois-le-Roi gave us the opposite reaction: we liked what we saw on the website, but the reality is better.

Now, we had references, so to speak, for this cottage: our friends the Germains and Rufins both know the owner, we heard that the remodeling work was done by a man who'd done work for both of them, so we expected the place to be fine. From the minute we walked in, though, we knew it would exceed our expectations. It is light, roomy, well-equipped, the re-modeled bathroom is beautiful, the yard is huge and green, it's on a quiet street, it's...well, perfect.

Some pictures:

[gallery columns="1" size="large" ids="2175,2174,2182,2176,2177,2179,2178,2183,2180"]

We have some time in September for which we hadn't figured out where we'd stay, but now we know: we'll come back here. This place is a wonderful find. It's 35 minutes by train to Paris, there are many walking trails, and if we're lazy, we can just sit in the yard chairs and enjoy the garden (with, of course, a glass or two of rosé).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't think we'll get to <em>all</em> the cheeses in France, but we're making an effort. Today:

Roquefort Vernieres
Reblochon
Crottin de Cavignol -  a famous chevre
Salers - never tried this one, but very similar to Cantal, which we like a lot. Actually, we like all them a lot.
Tommes de Savoie - had this last week and loved it, so what the heck: we'll have some more

We also bought a slab of <em>paté de campagne.</em>

Can't wait for lunch!

On the cheese place, clockwise from the top: Salers, Reblochon, Crottin de Cavignol, Roquefort, Tommes de Savoie. French readers are now saying, "What?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently a friend reading the blog (that's you, Frannie)&nbsp;asked us about food markets and how the French get their food, so I've taken some pictures and will write a bit about it in this post.

Although it's surely&nbsp;possible for someone here to buy all their food in a supermarket, it seems that few people do&nbsp;that. They&nbsp;buy staples and some food in supermarkets, things that need to be fresh&nbsp;from local two- or three-mornings-a-week markets (what we call "farmers markets" but here have much more than just produce) or from&nbsp;small stores. As we've understood better how to shop, and the strengths and weaknesses of each food source, we've really come to enjoy shopping in all of them, just as the French do.
<h2>Super Markets</h2>
There are, indeed, super markets here. Big supermarkets. Huge supermarkets. Supermarkets that make a Fred Meyer look like a corner store. They have everything, from groceries and staples to televisions, computers, furniture, refrigerators and whatever you might need. We have not shopped at one of these hyper-markets and likely won't.

Then there's the smaller super-markets that have all the staples, produce, meat and drink you could want, and some household appliances, such as coffee makers, toasters, and so forth. They also have an amazing selection of wine - now there's a surprise. Not to mention the amazing selection of box wines: maybe fifty different kinds. We always have one or two boxes (3 liters) on hand. They are surprisingly good and surprisingly inexpensive; we've become fans of Corbières, a red wine from the South, and we can buy a box for 9€ - &nbsp;about $2.50 per bottle equivalent; it's imminently drinkable.

Here's a picture of our local supermarket, Carrefour. There are Carrefours&nbsp;<em>everywhere.</em>

[gallery columns="1" size="large" ids="2236,2235,2234,2233"]

Two years ago our first trip to the local Carrefour was to stock a house that was empty and in which we were going to live for four and a half months. So in addition to tons of staples and food we&nbsp;bought a coffee-maker, toaster, water-filter carafe&nbsp;and a bunch of other things missing from the house. Because we were completely unfamiliar with the store, we were there&nbsp;for over two hours, filled a cart and a half, and ran up an over-400€ bill. They're still talking about us there, as the average person buys food for a couple days - maybe 20-30€.

There are also small stores that carry a bit of everything, including produce and meats. Here's our local:

[caption id="attachment_2212" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150612_DSC05388.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2212" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150612_DSC05388-1024x768.jpg" alt="A small &quot;has a little of everything&quot; market near us. The U.S.. equivalent is a 7-11, with groceries and produce added." width="640" height="480"></a> A small "has a little of everything" market near us. The U.S.. equivalent is a 7-11, with groceries and produce added.[/caption]

Next step down, in size, &nbsp;but usually a step up in quality and price, are the many small, local stores. These are owned privately, the owner usually is in the store with maybe an employee or two and the inventory is limited to one or two types of product. So, we have:

Boulangerie - bread, but most boulangeries are really boulangerie/patisseries, selling bread and pastries.
Patisserie - pastry; not many pastry-only patisseries left; they've combined with boulangeries.
Charcuterie - pork products.
Boucherie - other meats.
Chevaline - horse meat. I've seen a couple of these stores in Paris, and the biggest food markets may have a horse meat stall; haven't tried it, and don't plan to.
Fromagerie - cheese.
Epicerie -&nbsp;a small grocery store.
Poissonerie - fish.

Now, the fact is that many of these stores have disappeared in the smaller towns, such as Bois-le-Rois. There's no poisonniere here, no stand-alone boucherie or charcuterie. Fish we would get at the local twice-a-week market. The meats are available at one of two stores, one of which is also a fromagerie (our favorite store; we're already known well there). Where there once might have been several poissoneries and several charcuteries, now there may be one or two stores that have all types of meat and fish.

Here are a couple local stores:

[gallery columns="1" size="large" ids="2219,2213,2216,2215,2214,2217,2218"]
<h2>"Farmers Markets"</h2>
In the U.S., that's what we'd call these temporary markets. Here they're known as "<em>marchés locales</em>" and many towns have a market&nbsp;two or three mornings a week. They comprise of trucks with display cases&nbsp;that may go from market to market through the week, or, as in the case of our favorite cheese store, they may be a local store that has a presence at the local market. Our cheese shop is open five days&nbsp;a week, but on two mornings - Thursday and Sunday - Madame is&nbsp;at the Bois-le-Roi market.

Here are pictures of the Bois-le-Roi <em>marché local</em>&nbsp;on a Sunday morning. We don't know why, but this particular Sunday morning several "regular" vendors were not there. Still, you can see this is not a big market - Bois-le-Roi is about 5,000 people, so the <em>marché</em> reflects that size.

[gallery columns="1" size="large" ids="2222,2221,2220,2231,2230,2229,2227,2226,2223,2228"]

Fountainbleau is the nearest good-sized city. It has a much bigger - and more frenetic - market three days a week. Melun, bigger than Fountainbleau, has a permanent building for its <em>marché</em>, and because Melun has a large population from Africa, it is much more colorful and much more diverse in what it sells.

One last way we get our produce: on Thursdays at 4 in the afternoon, a truck straight from a farm appears at the location of the Thursday morning market - which has folded up and been gone since about noon - and sets up a table. The truck also has a number of bags of produce, picked that day and changing from week-to-week to reflect what was ready to pick in the the morning. For 10€ you get a bagful; no choice in what you get, as they're all pre-bagged. The next week, you exchange your now-empty bag and 10€ for another full bag. And this week, they also had strawberries and cherries, both of which were just fabulous. Not cheap, I can say, &nbsp;but about the freshest and tastiest imaginable.

[caption id="attachment_2210" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150611_DSC05383.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2210" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150611_DSC05383-1024x722.jpg" alt="Food from a truck straight from the farm. One bagful: 10€." width="640" height="451"></a> Food from a truck straight from the farm. One bagful: 10€.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_2211" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150611_DSC05387.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2211" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150611_DSC05387-1024x768.jpg" alt="Our bag o' food from the farm truck." width="640" height="480"></a> Our bag o' food from the farm truck.[/caption]

As you see, getting food here could be simple: go to Carrefour and get everything you need. But getting the freshest and best requires more work and is much more fun. We get staples at Carrefour and everything else in the smaller stores or the markets. Once we understood the routines of doing that, we found it to be much more fun, and we got much better food. We still feel stupid&nbsp;occasionally, but we believe that if we don't feel stupid at least&nbsp;once a day, we're not trying hard enough. The fact is that everyone treats us wonderfully, even after we have slaughtered their language. I suspect there are not a lot of Americans in the Bois-le-Roi <em>marché local</em>, and they like having us there as much as we like being there.]]></content:encoded>

[gallery columns="1" size="large" ids="2251,2252"]

Sunset is at 9:56 here right now; it'll be a couple minutes later after the solstice June 21. We like that. Given the clear skies we've had in the evenings, it means that it's light enough to do things outdoors until 10:30, and there's still light in the sky at 11.

Sunrise is about 5:57, but I wouldn't know that by observation. We're on vacation: we're not sleeping in late, but we're also not getting up very early. Why would we?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Geeze, one post after another! You'd think I had nothing better to do!

This morning we continued our search for <em>les affolantes</em>. For those who haven't read every word of this blog, the <em>affolantes </em>are houses built on the banks of the Seine in the late-1800s/early-1900s, by affluent Parisiens mostly, as summer houses. They are amazing. (see <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=1980">Affolantes</a>).

We went to the small village of La Rochette, which is the next town north of us here. It has a long road that goes along the Seine and there are quite a few simply beautiful houses on that road. Some are <em>affolantes, </em>built in the time mentioned above, others are newer. Mostly, we like the <em>affolantes</em> and not so much the newer homes. These houses all overlook the Seine. For some of them, trees have grown up to block the view, but others have unobstructed views of the river. (You can click on a picture to see it full-size.)

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2262,2264,2267,2265,2268,2263,2274,2271,2270,2269,2266,2273,2275,2272,2276"]
(I've thought about their name: <em>les affolantes</em>, which translates as "frightening" or "crazy." I thought that was strange, but realized that sometimes when I see a huge, modern, 5,000 sq ft house, in the States, my response can be, "Geeze, that's crazy," or "Man, that is frightening!" Well, these houses were the equivalent of those modern monstrosities 125 years ago, so I understand their name.)]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every June 21 - the Summer Solstice - Paris celebrates with an enormous music festival: the<em> Fete de la Musique</em>. Some years ago our late friend Barbara was in Paris on June 21, but she didn't know ahead of time about the celebration. She told us ,"There was music <em>everywhere</em> in Paris." and raved about the experience. Ever since, we've wanted to be here for the <em>fete</em> and yesterday, it worked out; we were there!

Now, about this festival: the official website lists about 500 musical performances in Paris, all free. They range from the most classical of classical music to the most avant-garde of avant-garde music. But the fact is that the official website lists maybe ten percent of the actual performances; there must have been thousands in total. We walked through a tiny slice the city and saw, oh, twenty different performances. Places des Vosges alone had probably ten going at any time, and they kept changing during the evening.

What did we see and hear? Well...here goes. (I apologize for the not-very-good pictures; it's hard to get a decent shot with a big crowd in the way). These are our favorites, in the order we saw them (we also saw quite a few more for a few minutes each.):
<h3>Organ Recital in Eglise Saint-Louis en l'Ile.</h3>
No program and announcements in French, so we don't know what we heard, but it was beautiful. Not a lot of people when we got there at the beginning, but the recital started at  4:30 and was to continue until 10 pm, and it was filling up when we left after 45 minutes, so I think they had lots of people there over the evening:

[caption id="attachment_2295" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05607.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2295" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05607-1024x673.jpg" alt="Eglise Saint-Louis en l'Ile" width="640" height="421" /></a> Eglise Saint-Louis en l'Ile[/caption]

As we left, we saw crowds at two stores: Berthillon Ice Cream

[caption id="attachment_2296" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05610.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2296 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05610-1024x616.jpg" alt="The line for Berthillon ice cream: out the door, down the street and around the corner." width="640" height="385" /></a> The line for Berthillon ice cream: out the door, down the street and around the corner.[/caption]

And Carolyn's favorite store in all of Paris:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05611.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2297" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05611-1024x768.jpg" alt="20150621_DSC05611" width="640" height="480" /></a>

And a puppeteer on the bridge between Ile St. Louis and Ile de la Citè.

[caption id="attachment_2298" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05613.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2298" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05613-1024x768.jpg" alt="A pupeteer entertaining kids on Pont Louis IV." width="640" height="480" /></a> A pupeteer entertaining kids on Pont Louis IV.[/caption]
<h3>A Couple Street Bands</h3>
At the west end of Ile Saint-Louis is a beautiful, quiet, tiny park. No so quiet today. This band wasn't the best, but they had lots of people dancing.

[caption id="attachment_2299" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05617.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2299" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05617-1024x728.jpg" alt="Not a great band, but soon after this couple started dancing, many joined in." width="640" height="455" /></a> Not a great band, but soon after this couple started dancing, many joined in.[/caption]

Then we bumped into this band playing at an imprompu beer/wine bar on the river. First song was Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World," sung in French with a reggae beat. Different...

[caption id="attachment_2300" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05621.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2300" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05621-1024x768.jpg" alt="On the banks of the Seine." width="640" height="480" /></a> On the banks of the Seine.[/caption]
<h3>Place des Vosges</h3>
Then on to Places des Vosges. Place des Vosges deserves a post of its own, but that's another day. It's a beautiful arcaded square (about 500 years old) and there was a lot of music going on under those arcades.

[caption id="attachment_2301" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05627.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2301" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05627-1024x768.jpg" alt="Place des Vosges." width="640" height="480" /></a> Place des Vosges.[/caption]

We never figured out what type of music this group was playing, but there were a bunch people who knew the dances to go with the music and they danced and danced and danced.

[caption id="attachment_2302" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05631.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2302" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05631-1024x655.jpg" alt="Never figured out what kind of music/dance this was." width="640" height="409" /></a> Never figured out what kind of music/dance this was.[/caption]

Then, after several other stops, we discovered Margot Varret:

[caption id="attachment_2303" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05640.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2303" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05640-1024x768.jpg" alt="Margot Varret - jazz harp! She was wonderful." width="640" height="480" /></a> Margot Varret - jazz harp! She was wonderful.[/caption]

Margot Varret trained as a classical harpist and then fell in love with jazz. She now has a quartet, but yesterday she was solo. Jazz harp: now there's something you don't see every day. She was fabulous; we hope to catch her with her quartet while we're here.

After a few more stops, another highlight. I'd read about this group on the website, but it was way more fun than we expected: the Tigresses. Six women - five of them our age; old, that is - and two men, all playing accordions. For each song, they handed out sheets with the words and everyone sang along; then they collected the sheets and did it again with the next song. Before they started they had over a hundred people waiting and when we left, probably triple that. A woman standing next to us said they're there every year, same place, same time, so they have a following. This was just crazy, and great fun.

[caption id="attachment_2304" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05646.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2304" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05646-1024x768.jpg" alt="The Tigresses" width="640" height="480" /></a> The Tigresses[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_2305" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05649.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2305 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05649-1024x768.jpg" alt="Big crowd singing along with the Tigresses and their eight accordions." width="640" height="480" /></a> This is the crowd singing along with the Tigresses and their eight accordions.[/caption]

By this time we'd been standing or walking for almost five hours and we were pooped. So we started back toward the flat, but got delayed. First, this small jazz group playing in a side street. We listened to them for half an hour. They unfortunately were in competition with four guys playing BIG and LOUD drums not too far away.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05651.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2306" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150621_DSC05651-1024x648.jpg" alt="20150621_DSC05651" width="640" height="405" /></a>

Then the topper. If you look at the top balcony of this apartment building - which is on a main street of Paris - you'll see three guys: two guitarists and a drummer. What you don't see are the amplifiers and speakers that filled that whole street with...good old American Rock 'n' Roll. Well, okay the "good" part might be a stretch; these guys are not going to make a living at this. But somehow, this summed up the <em>Fete de la Musique:</em> want to make some music? Find a place and start playing; a crowd will gather to hear you.

After five hours of standing and walking, we returned to the flat for a re-invigorating glass or two of wine and something to eat, figuring we'd re-charge and go back out. The re-invigorating part didn't work; we never got out the door again. We opened a bottle of wine, toasted Barbara and thanked her for getting us to the <em>Fete de la Musique</em>. This evening was definitely one of the most enjoyable times we've had in Paris over the twenty-five years we've been coming here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we were here a couple years ago, we walked the length of the Loing Canal from its start to past Nemours, doing couple-mile stretches as a time. Since we don't have any canals nearby, this year we're walking along the Seine, seeing what we can see and watching traffic on the river. It's a very enjoyable way to see the country-side, and get a little exercise while we're at it.

This amble took place over a few days, as we ran into rain the first day. (I might point out that this was really the first rain we've seen in five weeks, after a constant forecast of "nice today, but rain tomorrow"; everyday we heard that forecast and it was finally correct.)

So, without further ado (or blather), here are some pictures and c0mments from this amble...

[caption id="attachment_2330" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150618_DSC05545.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2330" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150618_DSC05545-1024x768.jpg" alt="Fontaine-le-Port City Hall (Mairie)" width="640" height="480" /></a> Fontaine-le-Port City Hall (Mairie)[/caption]

<i>Every</i> town in France has a city hall, almost always a nice-looking building. This is for the small village of Fontaine-le-Port (population: about 1,000).

[caption id="attachment_2331" align="aligncenter" width="375"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150618_DSC05550.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2331" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150618_DSC05550-225x300.jpg" alt="Main street of Fontaine-le-Port." width="375" height="500" /></a> Main street of Fontaine-le-Port.[/caption]

We found a path along the hills of Fontaine-le-Port and walked along it for a way, seeing beautiful views over the Seine and the country-side. Quite a few houses have this view...nice.

In the neighboring town of Samoreau, we came upon this Grange Hall. Yes, the same Grange Hall as we find in the United States and, originally, for the same purpose: to support the farmers of the area. This one has been around a long time; I'd put its construction about 200 years ago. Today it's used more as a community center.

It's always enjoyable to walk down a lane and see sights like this. This is a late-1800s house, likely. Not a real <i>chateau</i>, just a big house, but definitely beautiful. Beautiful estate, too.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05671.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2337" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05671-840x1024.jpg" alt="20150624_DSC05671" width="410" height="500" /></a>

Looking across the Seine at <i>affolantes</i> in Samois-sur-Seine.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05672.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2338" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05672-1024x768.jpg" alt="20150624_DSC05672" width="640" height="480" /></a>

We often see these reminders.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05675.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2339" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05675-1024x768.jpg" alt="20150624_DSC05675" width="640" height="480" /></a>
Note the ages: 19 and 20, and the date, August 1944. This area was liberated by the Allies soon after; not everyone lived to see it.

The biggest surprise: this is in a corner of a huge yard (probably 10-12 acres) of a huge and beautiful house:

[caption id="attachment_2340" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05680.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2340" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150624_DSC05680-1024x768.jpg" alt="Mirage III" width="640" height="480" /></a> Mirage III[/caption]

This plane came into the French Air Force ("Army of the Air" more accurately) in 1961. The house and land belong to a dentist. I have not been able to discover anything about just why he has a 50-year-old fighter jet in his backyard.

That's it for this amble. We try to get out for a walk every day and so they'll be more to follow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we were here two years ago, the first six weeks we had miserable weather: wet and cold almost the entire time. This trip, not so much. We've had a couple cloudy days, about two hours of light rain, and here's this week's forecast:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-29-10.34.14.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2356" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-29-10.34.14.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-06-29 10.34.14" width="645" height="349" /></a>

I'm okay with hot weather, so I'll be okay, but Laurie wilts. I suspect we'll be taking some long drives in our air-conditioned car this week. Or spending a <em>lot</em> of time the Carrefour market, which is kept so cold we wear fleece jackets there, no matter the time of day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Laurie tells me that a number of blog readers know our friends Mary and Gilles Germain, so she's asked me to post some pictures of Mary and Gilles and their family. As the whole family was in Bois-le-Roi this last weekend, with the exception of son-in-law Fabien, here goes.

The family gathered in stages. First, grandson Christian and son-in-law Fabien arrived. After a couple days Fabien left for home in Singapore and Mary &amp; Gilles took over full-time grandparent duties. Here's Gilles reading with Christian (3-1/2 years old).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC05597-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC05597-1.jpg" alt="DSC05597-1" width="432" height="576" /></a>

&nbsp;

Christian's mother, Anne, arrived a few days later, then William and Mathilde brought the newest grandchild -  Claire, nine months. We visited Mathilde and Claire one morning when all the Germains were doing family business:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06035-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2366" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06035-1.jpg" alt="DSC06035-1" width="576" height="432" /></a>At the end of the week, Eric came down from his Paris digs, and we had a family dinner (family plus us, that is).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06298-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2371" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06298-6.jpg" alt="DSC06298-6" width="576" height="432" /></a><em>Les Germain</em> sat (and stood) for a family portrait.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06168-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2367" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06168-2.jpg" alt="DSC06168-2" width="576" height="432" /></a>That's: Gilles &amp; Mary, Anne and Christian, William, Claire and Mathilde, and Eric.

I think Eric was about three when the Germains lived in Boulevard Lane. It was then that we got to know them. Thirty-five years ago...yikes!

And a couple of pictures of the next generation. Christian and Claire getting to know each other:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06210-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2370" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06210-5.jpg" alt="DSC06210-5" width="576" height="377" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06202-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2369" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06202-4.jpg" alt="DSC06202-4" width="463" height="576" /></a>

Laurie and Claire getting to know each other:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06030-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2365" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06030-1.jpg" alt="DSC06030-1" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Claire checking things out:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC08683-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2372" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC08683-1.jpg" alt="DSC08683-1" width="556" height="576" /></a>Anything better than baby's feet?

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06184-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2368" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DSC06184-3.jpg" alt="DSC06184-3" width="576" height="432" /></a>This is a wonderful family. Laurie and I are pleased and honored to have been included in their family gathering.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["La Canicule" is French for "heat wave," and that is exactly what we've had. This afternoon (Saturday, July 4; oddly enough, in France July 4th is just another day) it's about 82F with some rain and thunder showers. That's the coolest afternoon we've had in a week, and it's going to stay in the mid- to high-80s for a week. Last Tuesday it was 102F here; broke a record for the day.

I find it humorous that the French word for heat wave is pronounced "can-i-cool." Should be "canihot" or something.

The heat caused us to curtailed our activities some, but we moved in the middle of <em>la canicule</em>. Our stay in the cottage came to an end when we moved into our house-sit. We'll be here until August 31, and I can tell you, this will be a nice stay. This is a beautiful house, in a beautiful village. We're only ten minutes away from Bois-le-Roi, where we've lived for the last seven weeks, so we'll still be going there for the great cheese and boulangerie.

Here's the front of our new residence. The house was built in 1923 and seriously remodeled when the current owners moved in eight years ago. You can't see the remodel from the front; the entire first floor back wall was removed and the kitchen expanded and a living area added.

And the view from our bedroom. We love the window flowers - they're everywhere.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08755-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2408" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08755-1.jpg" alt="DSC08755-1" width="576" height="427" /></a>
As the weather is starting to moderate a bit, we'll get back to our ambles and rambles - a week from tomorrow we go to Lyon with Mary and Gilles - and I'll be a bit better about posting.
<h2>Addendum: More Information on Canicule</h2>
Gilles provided me with more information about how the French came to call a heat wave "canicule." <em>Canicule</em> derives from the Latin, <em>canicula</em>, which translates as "little dog." Canicula is also an alternative name for the constellation <em>canis major</em> ("big dog"). That constellation has, for centuries and in many cultures, been associated with the hottest days of summer. Hence: <em>canicule</em> - heat wave. Thank you, Gilles!

P.S. Don't ask me how the meaning went from <em>canicula</em> - little dog - to <em>canis major</em> - big dog. I don't know. Maybe the little dog grew up.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we walked in Thomery, a small town on the Seine not far from here. Last trip we'd been told that there was a beautiful walk in Thomery but we sure didn't find it and were disappointed in the town. We heard a week ago, though, that Thomery has an interesting history, and that it's possible to see and walk through that history, so off we went, and this time we were successful. We found a rewarding walk and an unusual bit of history.

The first official mention of Thomery is in some records of 1380. Yes, 1380. The town became famous in the 18th century when the <em>chasselas</em> grape became the favorite table grape of the French court and quickly after that, of all Paris. In the late-1800s, the town shipped 800 tonnes of this grape to Paris.

The visible part of this history is that the grape was grown on stone walls, and most of those walls still exist today. Now, they mark the boundaries of land attached to houses. There were once over 200 kilometers of these walls in Thomery; I suspect most still exist, though few are used to grow grapes anymore.

In its grape-growing heyday, someone determined that the optimal distance between these walls was 9 meters - about 30 feet. So row upon row of stone walls, about 7 - 10 ft tall, were constructed. Here is a Google Earth view of the central part of Thomery - you can see all the walls. This is maybe a quarter of the town, and almost all of it has these walls.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Thomery-view-2.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2437" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Thomery-view-2.jpeg" alt="Thomery view 2" width="896" height="660" /></a>
You can also see a diagonal path running through the center section of the walls, from upper-left to lower-right; this is the path we walked. Most of the plots of land are walled along the path, so we were unable to see into most of the yards, but where we could see into a yard we got a good idea of how these walls were used to grow the <em>chasselas</em> grape. Here are some pictures along the path.

Below you see the path itself. The walls on either side border the yards of private houses, whose yards are bordered by those 400 year-old grape walls.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08785-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2421" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08785-2.jpg" alt="DSC08785-2" width="338" height="450" /></a>

Here you see some walls in their original place. It's nine meters between the walls, which varied in length; many of them are several hundred meters long.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08786-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2422" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08786-3.jpg" alt="DSC08786-3" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Some walls do still have grapes growing on them, but they are few in number. The <i>chasselas</i> grape is grown in Switzerland now, and Thomery does grow and sell some, but it's mostly an artisan industry now.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08783-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2420" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08783-1.jpg" alt="DSC08783-1" width="576" height="432" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08801-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2425" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08801-6.jpg" alt="DSC08801-6" width="576" height="432" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08796-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2424" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08796-5.jpg" alt="DSC08796-5" width="576" height="432" /></a>

The second part of our walk proceeded along the Seine and ended at the old port of Thomery. Here the grapes (and other fruits from the area) were shipped to Paris by river. They could leave at night and be in Paris for the next day's markets. The biggest - and heaviest by far - product shipped from here were stone blocks, quarried from nearby and shipped to Paris for its buildings. This area became prosperous and has some beautiful houses on the main streets to and from the port.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08815-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2429" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08815-10.jpg" alt="DSC08815-10" width="576" height="432" /></a>

The view upriver from the port...

...and down river.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08817-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2431" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08817-12.jpg" alt="DSC08817-12" width="576" height="432" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08824-13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2432" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08824-13.jpg" alt="DSC08824-13" width="576" height="553" /></a>

Ah-ha! Another <i>affolante!</i> (For more about affolantes, see<i> Affolantes in Bois-le-Roi)</i>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08825-14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2433" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08825-14.jpg" alt="DSC08825-14" width="576" height="432" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08829-15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2434" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08829-15.jpg" alt="DSC08829-15" width="576" height="432" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08832-16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2435" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08832-16.jpg" alt="DSC08832-16" width="576" height="432" /></a>
And because someone knew Laurie was missing her Alaska roots, they put a totem pole in the backyard, just for her, I'm sure.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08834-17.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2436" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08834-17.jpg" alt="DSC08834-17" width="433" height="576" /></a>

We'll be back to Thomery, as we think there are more things to see, including some beautiful buildings along the Seine. We're thankful to Benoit, who told us about the path through the walls, making us go back to Thomery after a first disappointing trip. There are so many places like Thomery, small towns each of which have histories going back centuries. Often, some remnant of that history is still there and can be seen - just takes a bit of perseverence. We persevered with Thomery and were rewarded.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gotta love technology...

Checked email this morning and found two odd things: first, an email from the Internet provider that serves up this blog saying the storage for this blog was 98% full. As it's been about a third full, something was not right; second, all emails to john@zumsteg.us and laurie@zumsteg.us between June 20 and this morning have disappeared. As in, gone.

After a long on-line chat with the first-level tech guy at my hosting provider, he turned the mess over to Tech Support, which will try to find out what's gone wrong.

Then I discovered that all the pictures I've posted to the blog since June 20 are gone also. So if you look at some of the recent posts there may be placeholders instead of pictures. I will leave everything alone until Tech Support figures out what's gone wrong.

I've been fiddling with computers long enough to know that those three problems - a erroneous report of storage used, lost emails and missing pictures - are not isolated, un-related incidents, especially when two of them are related to a specific date. That would be too great a coincidence to have three serious things go wrong and not be related. I'm hopeful I'll have a fix today and all will be well.

<strong>Update</strong>: as of late Friday, almost all emails have been recovered and the pictures should be back on this blog. I haven't received - and likely will not received - a good answer as to what went wrong, but that's okay, as long as everything is working again. I do give credit to my hosting service, A Small Orange - yes, that's really its name - as they had four or five people working the problem yesterday. I do know it wasn't isolated to my account and I do know I was right - a number of directories on my site had been reset to what they contained on June 20. I'm sure any technical explanation would go right over my head.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Road trip! Whoo-hooo! Sunday we packed up the Germain-mobile and went with Mary and Gilles to Lyon, the second-biggest city in France. We probably would not have ever gone to Lyon but friends of ours were staying there for almost three weeks and we really wanted to see them, so this was the perfect time. Well, maybe not perfect, as it was hot-hot-hot in Lyon, the hottest area of France. But that was a minor distraction in a really excellent three-day visit to Lyon.

Let's get right to the real reason we went to Lyon: to share good food, good wine and good times with Jim and Maryann. Mission accomplished:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0053-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2493" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0053-2.jpg" alt="IMG_0053-2" width="463" height="576" /></a>

The six of us - Laurie and I, Mary and Gilles, and Jim and Maryann - joined up for dinner two nights and had just the best time imaginable. In the picture above we sat outside in the warm evening: we met at 7:30, drank some vin rosé, had dinner and got up from the table at 11:30. The next night we went to a small typical <em>bouchon</em>, which is what the old, working-class restaurants were called. Now, lots of new restaurants call themselves <em>bouchons</em>. The name really describes a typical bistro-style restaurant serving the food for which Lyon has been famous for centuries. The second night's dinner started at 8 and we left the restaurant about 11:30. Gotta love those long French meals. The dinners were great both nights - Maryann got to try steak tartare (you'll have to ask her about it) - and everyone agreed that Lyon's reputation for gastronomic excellence is no exaggeration. Food alone would be reason to visit this city.
<h2>Lyon</h2>
Lyon is famous for two things: food (see above) and silk. In 1535 François I granted a royal charter to two silk merchants in Lyon and, five years later, awarded a monopoly on French silk production to the city. By the mid-1600s, there were over 14,000 looms in Lyon and a third of the city was employed, directly or indirectly, in silk production.

It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. In the later-1700s automation started coming to the industry, threatening the thousands of <em>canuts </em>(silk workers). In the early 1800s Joseph Marie Jacquard perfected a loom that used punched cards to operate, allowing mass production of even complicated designs and putting out of work about two-thirds of the <em>canuts.</em> They revolted in 1831 and again in 1834, both times occupying the city and finally being beaten by the French Army.

Lyon has several museums dedicated to fabric, silk especially. The biggest, the <i>Musée des Tissus</i>, has many beautiful fabrics showing the history of the design and use of silk. Unfortunately, photography is prohibited there. But, I <em>had</em> to take a picture of these silk shoes:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09051.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2507" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09051.jpg" alt="DSC09051" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Today, the most visible remains of the old silk industry are the <em>traboules</em>, hidden passages through buildings that allowed silk to be transported throughout the old city without fear of it being ruined by rain. A number of these <em>traboules</em> still exist; here are some pictures of ones we walked through.

</table>
The <i>traboules</i> later served another purpose. During the German occupation of World War II, they were used to hide and move through the city Allied airmen who had parachuted from airplanes and escaped capture. Because the entrances to the <i>traboules</i> look just like any other door, the German soldiers looking for airmen could not track their movements. It's said that many an escaped Allied airman went through the <i>traboules</i> to freedom.
<h2>Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourvìere</h2>
If you've been to Paris you've surely seen the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, overlooking the city from the heights of Montmartre. Lyon has a church similar to Sacré-Cœur in many ways, but way different in appearance: the Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourvìere. Both basilicas were built about the same time, in the years immediately after the Prussian invasion of France in 1870-71. Both were built for the same reason: the city believed that Mary had interceded to save the city from the Prussians (though I don't know how they came to that conclusion in Paris, which was besieged, bombed and occupied by the Prussians) and so both are dedicated to the Virgin Mary. But while Sacré-Cœur has a distinctive white exterior and a decidedly un-interesting interior, Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourvìere has an interesting but not overly-dramatic exterior and an over-the-top interior. Pictures:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09042.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2492" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09042.jpg" alt="DSC09042" width="400" /></a>
Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourvìer from the River Saône. This is the view you see from everywhere in Lyon.

And the interior:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08908.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2467" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08908.jpg" alt="DSC08908" width="289" height="400" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08910.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2468" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08910.jpg" alt="DSC08910" width="300" height="400" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08921.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2469" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC08921.jpg" alt="DSC08921" width="300" height="400" /></a>
The word "ornate" does not come close to describing this interior. Not even close.
<h2>Some Modern Architecture</h2>
As the peninsula between the Saône and Rhone rivers narrows to a point at which they join, Lyon has built a number of modern buildings. We took a river tour and saw these. I love them.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09022.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2484" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09022.jpg" alt="DSC09022" width="400" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09025.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2485" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09025.jpg" alt="DSC09025" width="400" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09028.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2486" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09028.jpg" alt="DSC09028" width="400" /></a>These are apartment buildings. Very cool, we think.

But, as regular readers of this blog - both of you - know, I am not always enamored of modern architecture. Remember the blog on the Louis Vuitton Foundation building in Paris - loved it. Here is Lyon's museum effort - hate it.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09020.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2483" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09020.jpg" alt="DSC09020" width="400" /></a>
Where Frank Gehry's building for Vuitton Foundation soars gracefully (as does his Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain), this building seems heavy and clunky and decidedly un-beautiful. Just my opinion...

For some other more classical buildings that we love...along the Saône River, seen from our river tour.

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2491,2490,2489,2488,2487"]

Many of the buildings in the historic part of Lyon maintain the tradition of small signs handing above them. A few I saw:

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2482,2481,2479,2478,2480"]

And one last topic. Philippe DeLormé was a French architect of the 1500s. He was arguably the premier Renaissance architect in France, designing chateaux for Henri II. One of his first designs is in Lyon, where he was commissioned to create stairs and a gallery to connect two existing buildings, in a courtyard. The courtyard remains and I think it's a fascinating lesson on how the Remaissance changed architecture. Here are a couple pictures of his gallery and staircases; compare them to the buildings on the sides. The latter are pretty plain; DeLormé's gallery is beautiful.

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2475,2474"]
Phew! That's it for Lyon. Many thanks to Jim and Maryann for being there so we could visit them. We really enjoyed Lyon and our times with them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, we got back to our daily walks, and it felt good to be back and active again! We went earlier than usual this morning because it's hot, and we returned to the Seine, which we always love to walk along. We walked on the opposite side of the river from Thomery, which we visited a couple days ago (<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=2418">Thomery</a>). As always, we had some surprises...

Here's the road we walked along. About a third of the walk was on a trail, then we reached this road. Fortunately, not one car came along the road in the hour-plus that we were on it.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09078.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2522" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09078.jpg" alt="DSC09078" width="263" height="350" /></a>
We knew we were walking on the other side of the river from Thomery, and we knew we'd see some sights from that town, but this one surprised us:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09059.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2517" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09059.jpg" alt="DSC09059" width="576" height="415" /></a>This chateau, named "La Rivière," is on the northern edge of Thomery. We knew it was there from our earlier walk in Thomery, but we could not see it then. Today we saw it in its full glory. Rather nice, eh? The open windows indicate that someone is living there now. I'm trying to figure out to get a dinner invite, but since I don't even know who lives there, that might be difficult.

After another ten minutes of walking we could see the small ancient port of Thomery and got a different and lovely view of it from across the river:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09064.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2518" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09064.jpg" alt="DSC09064" width="500" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09072.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2519" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09072.jpg" alt="DSC09072" width="500" /></a>
Laurie likes the shutters and beautiful willow tree in the picture above.

After sitting and enjoying this view for a while, it was off again. As we walked down the road we paralleled a railroad track and came to a road going under the track with this sign on it:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09076.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2521" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09076.jpg" alt="DSC09076" width="350" /></a>
"Les Pressoirs du Roy" translates as "Presses of the King," presses in this case being cider or wine presses. Totally disregarding the Private Propery sign, we walked under the railroad and came upon this:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09074.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2520" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09074.jpg" alt="DSC09074" width="350" /></a>
Took a little research (reading a sign) and we learned that this is the "Cognac-Jay Maison d'Enfants À Caractère Social." I don't know of a direct comparison with anything in the United States; it's a home for children who, for some reason or another - usually legal; delinquency, that is - cannot remain in their home and school setting, so they come to a facility such as this. French law established these homes in 1945.

We walked almost two hours today. Going earlier meant it was cooler, and much of the walk was in the shade. We're glad the temps have cooled a bit (though it's still sultry). Not much we like better than walking along the river, unless it's drinking wine, which we like a lot.

We're off to our favorite place in France day after tomorrow: La Rochelle, a city with a rich history and today entirely dedicated to serving the best seafood in the world. Looking forward to that road-trip!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we were in France two years ago, we went to La Rochelle after reading Ina Caro's chapter on this historic city in her book, "Paris to the Past." Like her, we immediately fell in love with the place and returned later that year. Since then we've looked forward to a trip back to La Rochelle and Monday, off we went. We are happy to report that we love this place even more than ever.

First, our hotel. The first trip two years ago we lucked into the best room in the place: top floor, seaward corner. From its balcony we can watch the hundreds of boats going into and out of the harbor, many of them sailing students in classes.We can watch the tide covering and uncovering Richelieu's Dike, watch the sunset, and just generally enjoy life. This trip I had requested that room when I booked online but when we arrived, we learned that I had mistakenly also asked for a room with twin beds (I don't remember doing that) and so we had a different room. But the two managers on duty leapt into action with their computers and fifteen minutes later, had re-arranged room assignments so we could have our favorite room. Talk about customer service! Here's why we like that room:

La Rochelle is quite an historic town. For many years it was one of several towns that had permission of the French king to be Protestant. However, in 1627 that paragon of religious tolerance Cardinal Richelieu decided that he'd had just enough of that and laid siege to the city, building a dike across the harbor mouth to prevent La Rochelle from getting food and military supplies from the sea. The city, fearing surrender would mean a repeat of the Huguenot slaughter of 1572, held out. After 14 months, the population had dropped from 28,000 to 5,000 and the city surrendered, losing all its rights to religious freedom. I think the Cardinal forgot the "love your neighbor as yourself" part of his religious training...

Today the city is centered around its old port, which is not much changed from the days of the siege.

We were a little worried about what it would be like here in the middle of vacation season for the French. It was indeed jammed with French (and some Belgium and Dutch and British) tourists, but we loved even that part; La Rochelle is big enough to absorb them all and they all seemed to be in the area around the old port. There were thousands of tourists - all ages, sizes, shapes, many families, enjoying vacation in the great weather, just as we were. We walked back from dinner at 10:30 the last night, and the area around the old port was jammed. It was great fun, actually.

Laurie is an inveterate shoe-watcher, marveling at the variety of not-exactly sensible footware, particularly since most of these old cities have old cobblestone walks. She made me take this picture of the perfect strolling shoe:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09146.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2579" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09146.jpg" alt="DSC09146" width="576" height="432" /></a>
On the other hand (foot?), it was all I could do to keep her from rushing in to buy these shoes:

[caption id="attachment_2568" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00882.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2568" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00882.jpg" alt="109€ = about $125. They were on sale!" width="300" height="400" /></a> 109€ = about $125. They were on sale![/caption]

I talked Laurie out of buying those shoes by pointing out that she had just bought another pair, specially for the trip to La Rochelle. Here's proof: Laurie's feet in her new shoes (and our favorite red wine):

[caption id="attachment_2574" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09119.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2574" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC09119.jpg" alt="DSC09119" width="400" height="533" /></a> Laurie's new shoes. Not quite $125, fortunately; they were $3 on sale at Carrefour.[/caption]

Laurie loves to dip her toes in the Atlantic ocean when we're at La Rochelle. Here she is standing on the only remnant of Richelieu's dike (see above):

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00892.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2596" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00892.jpg" alt="DSC00892" width="300" height="400" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00894.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2597" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00894.jpg" alt="DSC00894" width="576" height="257" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00903.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2598" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00903.jpg" alt="DSC00903" width="300" height="400" /></a>

One thing we find interesting about La Rochelle is that the buildings of the downtown area all seem to have survived 300-400 years, not recently restored but continually maintained (not always well). In Paris, you'll see blocks of beautiful old buildings with a modern monstrosity right in the middle; here, there's none of that, so the streets have a distinctly ancient feel to them. Take away the cars and the modern stores on the ground floor, and you're in an 18th century city. Here are some pictures of the downtown area.

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2567,2566,2565,2563,2559,2557,2556,2555,2554,2553,2549,2548,2547"]

And you just have to love the sign on this pharmacy:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00860.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2560" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00860.jpg" alt="DSC00860" width="576" height="432" /></a>
"Founded in 1764"

We had some fine meals in La Rochelle, as you can imagine for two seafood-loving souls. Dinner our last night was at an excellent restaurant, Le Thiers Temp, where we both had swordfish. Now, I love swordfish and have it every time I can, and I can tell you that this was the best swordfish I've ever had, anywhere.

If that restaurant was a bit upscale, the night before? Not so much:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00822.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2591" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00822.jpg" alt="DSC00822" width="576" height="432" /></a>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00820.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2590" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00820.jpg" alt="DSC00820" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Le P'tit Bleu - we had grilled mussels (every restaurant in La Rochelle must serve mussels) and grilled calamari. You order, get a table in the back and a few minutes later a server shows up with your food, still too hot to eat. Both mussels and clamari were great. We actually love Le P'tit Bleu -  great food, low cost, sitting right next to the water of the old port on a warm night. Pretty nice.

La Rochelle has a huge market that seems to be there every day. Want strawberries or raspberries? We got 'em:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00844.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2551" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00844.jpg" alt="DSC00844" width="576" height="427" /></a>Want olives? We got 'em:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00842.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2550" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00842.jpg" alt="DSC00842" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Want shoes? We got 'em:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00848.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2552" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00848.jpg" alt="DSC00848" width="576" height="432" /></a>Indeed, this market had pretty much anything you'd want, including a pig's head and horsemeat. I declined photographing those...

That's La Rochelle. It is our favorite place in France and right up there on our list of favorite places in the world - maybe at the top. We already are looking forward to returning next year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know how it goes trying to get together with old friends: everyone's busy, schedules fill up, time gets short and soon, it's been way too long since you've seen them. I think that situation gets to the extreme, though, when you have to plan a get-together in Paris, but that's what we did the last week with long-time friends from Seattle.

[caption id="attachment_2626" align="aligncenter" width="450"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00959.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2626" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00959.jpg" alt="DSC00959" width="450" height="234" /></a> Our long-time friends Greg and Michele.[/caption]

First, our friends Greg and Michele arrived in Paris after a few days in London. We met them Saturday, had lunch, then went for a long walk. The next day we all went to what has become our favorite Paris museum, the Cité de la Architecture and du Patrimoine. I've written about this museum before, as we visited it a couple times last trip, and it still is the most impressive place.

This museum has three parts. The first is hundreds of casts of interesting and historic aspects of buildings around France, made in the early 1900s. Walking through the two galleries, you can see the highlights of French architecture, without ever leaving the building:

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2615,2616,2617,2618"]

The second section of the museum has replicas of old, old churches, with copies of the wall paintings of those churches. Pictures to follow, when I find them!

The third section we've neglected and will require another visit. It has many exhibits about how French cities developed. A key aspect of French cities is that their architecture often developed in areas of many city blocks, so there is a coherence to the architecture and to the way people live in them that is usually missing in cities that have just grown. One highlight of this part of the museum is a complete apartment unit created by Le Corbusier for an apartment block he created in Marseilles. Le Corbu is universally recognized as the first and probably best of the Modernist architects, and he was deeply interested in creating complete living environments, with parks and schools and stores, rather than just creating a building. We'll return to see this floor more thoroughly and I'll post more about it.

An amazing museum, worth a couple days of visiting, we think.

We also found that the museum has a rather nice place to sit and rest.

[caption id="attachment_2624" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00953.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2624" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00953.jpg" alt="DSC00953" width="400" height="300" /></a> Hard to beat this view.[/caption]

Then Monday our friend Norma arrived in Paris. A month ago she emailed me about something and when I told her we were in France, she replied, "I'm coming to France!" and indeed she did. We met her Monday and spent a few hours in Paris.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00967.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2628" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00967.jpg" alt="DSC00967" width="500" height="375" /></a>

Then we took the train to our France home-for-a-couple-months, Samois-sur-Seine.

First on the next day's agenda: get cheese! Here's Norma at our favorite (well, favorite <em>and</em> only cheese shop).
<p class="alignnone"><a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC009721.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2636" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC009721.jpg" alt="DSC00972" width="331" height="400" /></a>Tuesday we went to one of our favorite small towns, Moret-sur-Loing (for more on Moret, look at <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=323">Moret-sur-Loing, 2013</a>). Norma had exactly the same reaction we had two years ago: love at first sight. Moret remains a favorite place for us.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00975.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2608" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC00975.jpg" alt="DSC00975" width="467" height="350" /></a></p>
&nbsp;

We also had some very nice meals:

[gallery size="medium" columns="2" ids="2635,2640,2634"]

Then, it was time to go...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0271.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2649" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0271.jpg" alt="IMG_0271" width="300" height="400" /></a>

It was great fun to see our friends here, and to show them the city we love and the country-side that we also love.

Tomorrow: off to Brittany.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Friday we saddled up the trusty old Renault and headed to Brittany to celebrate a bunch of birthdays. Our friends Jamie and Hervé Rufin, who have vacationed on the Presq'ile Quiberon for a number of years, last year bought a beautiful house there and invited three couples to join them over a long weekend; three of the four wives were celebrating birthdays that weekend, Laurie's is not too far away, and one husband's was the day before we arrived - a plethora of reasons to celebrate!

First, where were we? The Quiberon Peninsula is on the southwestern edge of Brittany:

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2700,2701"]

Here are some pictures of Saint-Pierre-Quiberon:

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2702,2703,2704,2670"]

On the other side of the peninsula is the Côte Sauvage - the Wild Coast. It reminds us a lot of the Oregon coast.

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2698,2696,2695,2694,2693,2692"]

We walked a lot on the Côte Sauvage, especially at low tide; very beautiful. I even went into the water, and though I tried to stay in, I couldn't make it warm enough, so I didn't last long.

And there were birthdays to celebrate. We arrived on Friday, July 31; Saturday was Valérie's birthday, Sunday was Mary's and Monday was Jamie's (and the day before had been Yves - Valérie's husband.) And they decided to include Laurie, whose birthday is only a month away. So there was some serious celebrating to do.

We went out for a wonderful - at the time - meal Saturday night, then Sunday night we had dinner at <em>chez Rufin</em>, where the kitchen was in full swing, and Gilles took over duties as Master Barbecuer and Carver.

Unfortunately, early the next morning three of us encountered a serious side affect of something, as Jamie, Laurie and I all had what can only have been food poisoning. The one thing we ate in common was oysters for a first course Saturday night, and there are indeed, food poisoning bacteria that take 24 hours to develop. The three of us pretty much spent the day in bed Monday. That was Jamie's birthday; what a way to spend it. Fortunately, by Tuesday she was still tired, but had recovered enough to have a small celebration.

Monday, the group - less Valérie and Yves, who had family commitments that took them away -  went to one of our favorite places in the world: Carnac. This is the home of the largest collection of menhirs (standing stones) in the world. This time, we took an excellent tour (in English!) inside the fences that surround the alignments. Because tourists were causing damage to the alignments, they were closed off twenty-five years ago and the only way to get inside is to take a tour, so we did. We learned lots and though you can see the alignments well from outside the fences, it was great to get inside and see them from a close-up and personal perspective.

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2680,2684,2682,2681,2685,1298,1299,1300,2686"]

There are about 3,000 menhirs still standing, and archeologists believe that originally there were about double that amount. Over the years, some were removed to build houses and then, at some point, a bunch were removed so a couple roads could be built! Really? Damage a 5,000 year-old unique-in-the-world site to build a road? What were they thinking?

These alignments were built over a span of 2,000 years, ending about ten centuries before the pyramids of Egypt were started. Our guide said, "You can ask me 'Who? When? How?' and I can give you an answer, but if you ask, 'Why?', no one can answer that." Gotta love the mystery.

Wednesday - a day later than planned, as we decided to spend an extra day recovering - we took one last walk on the beach, had a wonderful lunch of <em>moules-frites </em>(mussels and fries) and headed for home.

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2697,2696"]

Jamie and Hervé and their family have been coming to Presq'ile Quiberon for many years; this year they realized a dream when they bought their house there. We have come to Presq'ile Quiberon twice now and though we likely won't be buying a house there, we will return. This truly is a beautiful place and we understand why <em>les Rufin</em> love it so much.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi,  I've really enjoyed viewing all the great photos that make you feel you're right there, and the collection of interesting information and stories was amazing. Yes, the Cote Sauvage reminds one of the Oregon Coast. The standing stones at Carnac looked amazing. On my cruise to the British Isles, I saw some very tall standing stones on the Orkney Islands in Scotland. That seemed to be the thing to do way back when. Sharon and I enjoyed our British Isles cruise, but there wasn't enough time to really explore. We were in Le Havre on May 31. Continue to enjoy your many adventures.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Henry George Zumsteg was born to Craig and Annie this morning at 3:45, New York time. Henry weighed in at 8 lbs, 2 oz, 20 inches. No word yet as to whether he got his sister's red hair. Mom, Dad and baby are all doing well.

We're grandparents again, and happy as can be. Champagne will be drunk tonight (they have some here in France)!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh, boy, a road trip! Last Sunday we took off with Mary and Gilles on a road trip to the city of Reims and a tiny town in the middle of a World War I battle site. We wanted to return to Reims because we loved the city when we were there two years ago and wanted to see it again. Also, Reims is the big city in the region that produces champagne and we can always use some more champagne. We wanted to visit some World War I sites because, well, that's been kind of a forgotten war in the United States and as I read about World War II, I realized that I knew nothing about its predecessor.

I'll post about Reims first because that's where we went first and also because I've got to let the WW I stuff sink in a bit; it was pretty moving and powerful.
<h2>So...Reims and Champagne</h2>
Let's start with the Cathedral. I've written about this before (<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=1691">Reims, 2013</a>), but a few words. All the kings of France, save two, were crowned here, starting with Clovis in 496 and ending with Charles X in 1825. The cathedral was damaged badly during World War I, as was all of Reims, but has been mostly re-constructed. Our favorite part is the modern stained-glass windows installed over the last ten years. Laurie and I spent a long time looking at these, and then returned the last morning we were in Reims for another look.

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2745,2751,2748,2747,2753"]

This is the iconic "Smiling Angel" on the facade of the Cathedral, probably the most famous church carving anywhere. We said, "Au revoir" to her, as we certainly will return to this Cathedral.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Reims-1-of-20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2746" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Reims-1-of-20.jpg" alt="Reims (1 of 20)" width="432" height="576" /></a>
<h2>Reims Automobile Museum</h2>
Yep, we went to a great car museum in Reims. This is a private collection, and it's mostly French cars, starting at the turn of the century. Gilles and I enjoyed it greatly, and Mary and Laurie were gracious enough to say they enjoyed it, too.

Some highlights:

<h2>Rosengart</h2>
I know that most of you - well, the car enthusiasts, anyway - are saying, "But John, did the museum have any Rosengarts?" Well, of course it did; for those who have always wanted to know more about Rosengart automobiles, here are the ones in the museum:

[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="2765,2766,2763,2767"]

Amazing, eh? All those Rosengarts in one place. (Rosengart went out of business in 1953, after a long and less than illustrious history. Honestly, I'd never heard of Rosengart until I saw these.)<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Reims-16-of-20.jpg">

<h2>Champagne</h2>
The next day, to recover from the excitement of the Automobile Museum, we went to the heart of the Champagne region to buy some champagne, of course! Now, you may recall my rant from a couple years ago about the "showing off" nature of many wineries in the U.S. of A, where you can buy logo hats, logo coats, logo shirts, logo wine-openers, logo mukluks, and oh, yeah, wine. So here's some pictures of the champagne maker we visited.

First, we had to find the place, and fortunately Mary and Gilles had been there before. Note the lack of signage:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-1-of-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2773" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-1-of-6.jpg" alt="Champagne (1 of 6)" width="400" height="300" /></a>

&nbsp;

The Patronne greeted us and took us into the beautiful tasting room (which also doubles as the company office).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-6-of-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2778" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-6-of-6.jpg" alt="Champagne (6 of 6)" width="400" height="300" /></a>Note the beautiful decorations...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-2-of-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2774" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-2-of-6.jpg" alt="Champagne (2 of 6)" width="400" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-3-of-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2775" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-3-of-6.jpg" alt="Champagne (3 of 6)" width="400" height="300" /></a>The Patronne, who, with her husband, has been making champagne for a <em>loooooong </em>time, asked us what we'd like to try. She then went out, got a bottle of it, uncorked it and proceeded to pour five (one for herself, of course) full-sized glasses of her champagne. No tiny sips here.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-4-of-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2776" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Champagne-4-of-6.jpg" alt="Champagne (4 of 6)" width="357" height="400" /></a>When we'd tasted her amazingly good champagne, she poured us all another glass and left to get our order. It was a good thing we'd already decided what to buy, because after a couple glasses we might have ordered ten or twelve cases each.

A word about champagne: in the United States we think of champagne as a drink reserved for special occasions. Here in France it's usually the same: champagne served on a special occasion, except that almost anything qualifies as a special occasion: friends over for dinner, getting together for a drink, a sunny day. It's not at all unusual to have champagne here, a custom we really like.

Another word about champagne: there really are three types. Most champagne contains juice from chardonnay and pinot noir grapes. Then there is <em>blanc de noirs</em>, which is made entirely of pinot noir juice. Finally, and new to us, is <em>blanc de blanc, </em>which is 100% chardonnay. I'm sure wine stores in the States have <em>blanc de blanc</em>, but it's not common and we'd never had it until early in our trip this year. We love it. It seems softer than the other two types; purer, maybe. Anyway, after our trip to the champagne country we have a bunch of it. Can't wait for a special occasion. Oh, look, it's a sunny day...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will forgive you if you haven't heard of the French town of Nantillois; after all, its current population is 64. Fortunately for us, two of those 64 are Maarten and Didi, a Dutch couple who moved to Nantillois eight years ago and opened a wonderful Bed &amp; Breakfast. They are a great team: Didi runs the B &amp; B, and cooks lovely dinners for guests; Maarten has a small World War I museum, a huge amount of knowledge about that war, and gives guided battle-site tours of the area. Both of them provide a warm welcome and a memorable stay. Hmmmm, sounds like a TripAdvisor review.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14-18Nantillois.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2822" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14-18Nantillois.jpg" alt="14-18Nantillois" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Anyway...Nantillois is about 20 miles north of Verdun, where the best-known battle of World War I took place: a ten-month affair that cost the French and Germans  about 350,000 soldiers each and accomplished exactly nothing in terms of ground gained. There's some stuff to see in that area, but we prefer being away from the tourist areas and this practice worked well for us here.

This is likely to be a long and maybe not too interesting post, especially if you're not a history buff. I will not be (too) offended if you skip the rest.
<h2>A Quick Review of World War I</h2>
The centenary of the start of World War I has brought some recent interest in that war, but mostly it has been overshadowed by the second World War. A quick summary:

Leading up to 1914, almost all the countries of Europe entered into treaties with other countries, treaties that locked countries into defending each other should one of the countries be attacked. This became a huge and complicated web, and its result was that when, in June 1914, the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia, a long line of treaties were activated and brought all the European powers into conflict, culminating in early August when Germany declared war on Russia and France, and the response was Russia, France and Britain declaring war on Germany. The madness commenced.

Germany invaded France and Belgium with some success, pushing to the Marne River in France and establishing a line from Belgium southeast across France. But France and Britain stopped the German forces there and both sides "dug in," building an astonishingly complex series of trenches to defend their lines. Often the front lines of these trenches were just a few hundred yards apart. For three years, there were skirmishes along those lines as one side or the other attempted to gain some territory, but essentially, the front moved very little and often at a profound cost in lives.

World War I differed profoundly from earlier wars; where war had always been a matter of conquering territory, WWI was a war of attrition: kill soldiers of the other side faster than they kill your soldiers. For four years, both sides tried to outlast and out-kill the other. It wasn't until the United States entered the war in 1918 and sent 2 million fresh troops and $billions of new, state-of-the-art equipment that the west was able to finally overwhelm and push back the Germans. Once the big Allied assault began in September of 1918, it took less than 60 days to end the war.

Okay, enough background. We wanted to see and feel this history, and indeed we did. The first glimpse was in the Argonne Forest, where the trench lines had been the scene of four years of skirmishes. The first sight of a trench - many remain - was almost startling, like seeing a ghost of the past.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WWI-5-of-25.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2794" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WWI-5-of-25.jpg" alt="WWI (5 of 25)" width="299" height="399" /></a>It has, of course, worn down over the years, but it's still there and still eerie. Soldiers would rotate between the front-line trenches and safer camps a mile or so behind them. There are, in many places, huge complexes of trenches, with multiple parallel lines. In areas such as the Argonne Forest these lines would have been under almost constant shelling from artillery.

It's something of a misnomer to have called this the Battle of the Argonne Forest because there wasn't much forest left from early in the war; artillery destroyed it. Today the trees are all under one hundred years old and the usually-level ground of the forest still shows the effects of the bombing:

[caption id="attachment_2797" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WWI-8-of-25.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2797" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WWI-8-of-25.jpg" alt="WWI (8 of 25)" width="400" height="300" /></a> Young trees and ground mounded and cratered by artillery shelling for almost four years.[/caption]

Not much forest left.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/argonne_forest.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2815" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/argonne_forest.jpg" alt="argonne_forest" width="864" height="425" /></a>In late September 1918 the Allies - mostly France, Britain and the United States - started the offensive that would end the war. Nantillois was in German hands and had been for several years so the whole area was well defended. Maarten took us on a three-hour walking tour of the area, describing the battles as the American troops, responsible for pushing the Germans out of the region, progressed across the country-side. The picture below is at the edge of a forest; American soldiers came from the forest at the right (Montfaucon, which required two days to take and was so completely destroyed that the town was rebuilt half a mile away), across the hills and then to the forest on the right of the bottom picture, which looks in the opposite direction. The battle plan was to take all this in a day, but the defenses were much stiffer than expected, and a week was needed to clear this area.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/nantillois.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2816" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/nantillois.jpg" alt="nantillois" width="576" height="323" /></a>

Here Maarten was invaluable, as he described the movement and difficulties and battles. We could stand there and envision the soldiers moving across the fields, encountering horrendous machine-gun fire from German forces dug into the top of each hill. It was cold, pouring rain, and the troops outran their supplies; some units went four days without food.

Maarten then took us through the forest. German troops had a large camp there, and were well dug-in.

American troops in the forest got a break when they had to wait for units alongside them to catch up. They dug foxholes and rested - as much as one can rest in a rain-filled hole. This area has hundreds of these foxholes still visible.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WWI-1-of-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2818" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WWI-1-of-11.jpg" alt="WWI (1 of 1)" width="300" height="400" /></a>

Maarten has discovered thousands of artifacts of the war and told us that walking through a freshly plowed field will always result in such discoveries. Laurie and I did that our last morning and in fifteen minutes found half a dozen such artifacts: a horseshoe, some pieces of a horse's tackle, part of an artillery shell and some unidentifiable scrap.

We saw much more and visited several other very interesting sites, but enough is enough. I'll leave you with just a couple more pictures.

It was moving to visit these sites, to be able to "see" the things that happened at each of them, to feel the human element. These weren't just battles on a chess board; there were real people, just like us, doing their best in absolutely appalling conditions: they were hungry, cold, wet, bone-tired and, more than anything, they were scared all the time. We talk of sending men to war, but we don't; we send boys. Most of the soldiers in these armies - on both sides - were eighteen or nineteen years old; tested veterans were twenty-one or twenty-two or twenty-three. These were kids, just trying to do their best and just trying to survive. Way, <em>way </em>too many did not:

The United States lost 126,000 boys in World War I; France lost 1,375,000; Germany, 1,773,000; Russia, 1,700,000; Austria-Hungary, 1,200,000. No wonder Laurie and I have become more adamantly pacifist and non-violent as we've grown older. The only thing World War I accomplished was to set  the stage for World War II, at a cost of 8.3 million soldiers killed and 19 million wounded.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been living in the village of Samois-sur-Seine for almost two months now (our house-sit ends next Monday and we'll be homeless for a while...) so I think it's time to post some pictures about Samois.

Samois-sur-Seine ("Samois on the Seine River") has about 2,400 residents. It is definitely a quiet town: one bakery (just re-opened to the great hopes of residents, since the previous bakery was not well known for the quality of its bread), a butcher, a few stores, a few restaurants on the river and a couple in town, several <em>affolantes</em> (fancy houses built on the river in the 1800s and early 1900s) and a nice mix of other houses. It's kind of a typical small village, really.
<h3>Our digs in Samois:</h3>
[caption id="attachment_2864" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Samois-23.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2864" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Samois-23.jpg" alt="Samois-23" width="400" height="300" /></a> Looking down our street, rue Maximilian Lambert (whoever he was).[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_2865" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Samois-24.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2865" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Samois-24.jpg" alt="Samois-24" width="400" height="300" /></a> Our house-sit digs. This is a beautiful house, with an expanded and remodeled kitchen and living room.[/caption]
<h3>Some other Samois houses...</h3>
[caption id="attachment_2856" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Samois-15.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2856" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Samois-15.jpg" alt="Samois-15" width="400" height="300" /></a> A house on the Seine river. Nice, but what an upkeep nightmare. Of course, I guess if you can afford the house, you can afford the upkeep.[/caption]

<h3>Samois' Most Famous Person</h3>
The jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt lived here the last few years of his way-too-short life (he died here in 1953, at age 43).  In the late 1920s and 1930s, Django invented a style of jazz, popularly known as "gypsy jazz" but more accurately called "<em>manouche</em>," that remains crazily popular today. There are <em>thousands</em> of manouche jazz bands in the world still; Seattle's Pearl Django is one of the best.

Almost always there are guitar picks on it. We paid a visit whenever we were in Samois before, and now it's less than half a mile away.[/caption]

Interestingly, the next famous person from Samois-sur-Seine is also a jazz performer. Aimée Cyrille is from here. We saw her in Seattle last year and she was amazed that we not only knew of Samois, but that we'd been there and knew people here. She is nothing short of phenomenal; if you get the opportunity to see her, do it!

That's our current home-away-from-home. Samois is a beautiful little village; we've enjoyed our time here a lot.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever since we arrived in mid-May, Hervé Rufin has been trying to organize a Saturday night visit to the chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte for the candle-light visit. Finally, last Saturday the stars aligned and we made it.

Vaux-le-Compte has quite a history. Before 1657 it was a small chateau and garden, owned by Nicholas Fouquet who was a member of the <em>Parlement de Paris</em> and an enthusastic patron and supporter of the arts. In 1657 King Louis XIV made Fouquet his Minister of Finance which, for some odd reason, immensely increased Fouquet's wealth. He then bought three towns around the old chateau, hired the best architect (Louis le Vau) and the best landscape architect (Le Notre), the best decorator (Charles le Brun) and twenty thousand laborers. Five years later the Chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte was complete - appearing much as it does today.

(Full disclosure: because we were there at night and I didn't want to drag a tripod around, I took zero pictures; these are taken from the Web).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0_Maincy_-_Château_de_Vaux-le-Vicomte_2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2889" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0_Maincy_-_Château_de_Vaux-le-Vicomte_2.jpg" alt="La façade sud du château de Vaux-le-Vicomte vue depuis le &quot;rond d'eau&quot; - Maincy (Seine-et-Marne, France)." width="600" height="400" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/www.MyGorgeousWedding.com-GET-MARRIED-A-LA-FRANCAISE-VAUX-LE-VICOMTE-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2888" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/www.MyGorgeousWedding.com-GET-MARRIED-A-LA-FRANCAISE-VAUX-LE-VICOMTE-8-1024x682.jpg" alt="www.MyGorgeousWedding.com-GET-MARRIED-A-LA-FRANCAISE-VAUX-LE-VICOMTE-8" width="640" height="426" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/epic_11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2887" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/epic_11.jpg" alt="epic_11" width="601" height="475" /></a>
We were there for the night visit, so here's a picture of the chateau with its 2,000 candles. It was truly a beautiful sight.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/61491-vaux-le-vicomte-soiree-aux-chandelles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2885" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/61491-vaux-le-vicomte-soiree-aux-chandelles.jpg" alt="61491-vaux-le-vicomte-soiree-aux-chandelles" width="601" height="395" /></a>Mary took this picture of Laurie and me. Not many pictures of me in this blog, as I'm usually doing the picture-taking.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSCF0061.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2886" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSCF0061-1024x768.jpg" alt="DSCF0061" width="640" height="480" /></a>The night was warm and beautiful, and after a fabulous fireworks display, we decided to wait out the crowds leaving the parking lot by having a glass of champagne. So our last memory of the evening is sitting in lounge chairs at 11:30 at night, in the warm air, sipping our champagne as we looked at the candle-lit chateau. Now, is that the way to spend an evening or what?

Thanks - many, many thanks - to Hervé for getting us organized for this night. It will certainly be the most memorable evening of our stay here this year, and will draw us back again on future trips.

Oh, one last bit of history about the chateau. In 1651, not long after the chateau and gardens were completed, Fouquet held an enormous <em>fete</em> to show it off. It succeeded too well: Louis XIV was invited, became convinced that the money to build it had come from royal funds diverted by Fouquet in his role as Finance Minister to the chateau, and had Fouquet arrested. He then swiped the artists - le Vau, Le Notre and Le Brun - and took them to Versailles, where they created a chateau even grander than Vaux-le-Comte.

Today Versailles is wall-to-wall tourists all the time; Laurie and I have never visited it. Vaux-le-Compte may be a "mini-Versailles," but its beauty is just overwhelming and much easier to visit andview; we'll be back.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have wanted to visit Venice for many years, and last week we finally were able to do that. Our reaction: highly mixed. It's an amazingly beautiful city and we loved walking along the canals, but we also saw what tourism is doing to this ancient city, and it ain't pretty.

Much of Venice looks as it has for years: beautiful houses on quiet canals. But the main areas of interest are a nightmare of crowds; a friend describes Venice's Piazza St Marco as "heaving with people." I did some digging around and learned that during the five days we were in Venice, it's likely that some 50,000 tourists were with us in the city each day. This is a small city and those 50,000 people were in a small part of this small city. The number of daily tourists nearly out-numbers the residents (about 58,000, and declining every year). During June and July, the tourist flood daily exceeds 60,000 people (one weekend this summer, tourist ships alone added 35,000 to the inundation).
<h2>Where the Tourists Are: It's a Mess.</h2>

Really. And unless you're willing to seek out a gondolier away from the tourist areas, you're likely to be in gondola traffic jam, like this picture.[/caption]

Honestly, I'm not sure why all these people are here. Venice has a spectacular collection of Renaissance art, but when we visited one of the best - the amazing paintings of Tintoretto at Scola San Rocco - we were almost alone; there were no more than a dozen people in the building besides us . So most of these folks aren't here to see the art. The most beautiful places were away from Piazza San Marcos, and they were deserted (see below). I don't get it, actually.
<h2>The Grand Canal</h2>
The Grand Canal is the "Main Street" of Venice, making a large 'S' through the city.

<h2>Venice Away from the Tourists: It's Beautiful</h2>
Okay, I've ranted about the ugliness of tourism in Venice. It's also true that Venice is beautiful and contains many wonderful surprises. You just have to get off the tourist path.

The restaurant in the picture below is known for its <em>chichettas</em> (Italian tapas, essentially); it has room for about a dozen people and standing room outside for six or eight more. The street you see in the background is a main tourist route and was always jammed. Yet fifty feet away, here sits this restaurant with nothing but local people (and us).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09115.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2937" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09115.jpg" alt="DSC09115" width="375" height="500" /></a>

Laurie and I walked and walked and walked and learned that around any corner can be a breathtakingly beautiful scene - Renaissance pallazos, colorful homes, quiet canals. So to give Venice its due, here are some of those scenes. This part of Venice we loved.
We spent the better part of two days walking the "back streets" (though there really aren't any streets) of Venice. We loved this aspect of the city.

<h2>Regatta Storica</h2>
We just happened to be in Venice for the Regatta Storica - the Historical Regatta. As it turned out, the Venice authorities realized that September 6 was Laurie's birthday and scheduled the Regatta that day just for her and 50,000 people turned out to celebrate with her.

The Regatta included some beautiful historic gondolas followed by gondola races. The historic gondolas - complete with gondoliers and passengers in costumes of past times - were beautiful. The gondola races...well, we watched the boats race down the Grand Canal and then twenty minutes later race back up to the finish line. Not so interesting for us, but we loved the historic boats.

[caption id="attachment_2916" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC08894.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2916" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC08894.jpg" alt="DSC08894" width="500" height="375" /></a> It was a bit busy on the Grand Canal for the Regatta Storica.[/caption]

Now we've fulfilled our desire to visit Venice. Did we enjoy it? Yes, definitely, as long as we stayed away from the main tourist areas. Will we return? I doubt it. We've seen what we want to see and we don't want to fight the crowds to see the rest. Do we worry about the future of this ancient beautiful city? Definitely - we can't see a way that it returns to a slower, less tourist-oriented existence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning I ran into the same technical problems as I had in early July, so if pictures - particularly in the Venice post - are gone, bear with me. I'll get them back, but it may take a day or two.

<em>Update Monday, 9/14</em>. All is well, technical-wise. My Internet provider did a fine job getting emails back, and I was able to rebuild the photo directory for the blog, so all is well. Still, the ISP has some 'splainin' to do, and I've told them to get as technical as they need to - I'll understand - but they have to figure out why I've had emails and photos disappear twice now and what they're doing to ensure it doesn't happen again. We'll see...I'm going to get pretty ornery if they slough me off with the "it was just a glitch" line.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Laurie and I went to Chateau de Fontainebleau again. This is at least our third visit (and maybe the fourth) and we enjoy it more each time.
<h2>The Best Audio Guide We've Encountered</h2>
Today we rented the audio guide and were pleased by how good it was. When these guides use technology well, they can really add to the enjoyment of a visit. The Chateau's audio guides are smart-phones in disguise and so they can do cool things: pictures of each room as you enter it, so you know you're in the right room, a "Location" button that when pressed shows a 3-D view of the entire Chateau with your location marked, excellent narratives, with the ability to easily access additional narratives with greater detail or on related subjects. Cost: 3€ ($3.50); I can tell you that was money well spent!

We visited the Chateau last trip; if you want to get more information look at <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=1380">Chateau de Fontainebleau, 2013</a>. The first royal edifice was built here in the 12th century, and different kings and queens added, changed, tore down and rebuilt from then until the last royalty left (that was Napoleon III, nephew of the real Napoleon, "Emperor" from 1851 until he was captured by the German army in the French-Prussian war in 1870; by the time he was released, France had moved on from his emperorship and so he moved on to England).

Many people think Chateau de Fontainebleau is more interesting and historical than Versailles, as many kings and queens contributed to it, whereas Versailles was one king. It also is way less crowded! We've heard that almost any time of the year, Versailles is wall-to-wall people. You'll see in the pictures of this post that, even with a bunch of school groups touring today, it was very comfortable.

We walked in from a back gate so we could walk through the gardens (and get free parking)[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_2980" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09175.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2980" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09175.jpg" alt="DSC09175" width="500" height="334" /></a> Chateau de Fontainbleau - front court. At the end of the walkway is the famous stairway from which Napoleon said good-bye to his Imperial Guard...the first time. He'd be back, with disastrous results for the army (Waterloo).[/caption]

Can you say "ornate?" This is the view from the main floor, where the court hangers-on would have sat.[/caption]

Though much of the official literature of the Chateau said that the Diana - to whom there are many references throughout the Chateau - meant Diana, Goddess of the Hunt, it's much more likely that they referred to Diane DePoitiers, mistress of Henry II.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_2977" align="aligncenter" width="339"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09165.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2977" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09165.jpg" alt="DSC09165" width="339" height="500" /></a> Napoleon's Throne. You have to love history like this: this is the real, authentic, actual throne Napoleon used in the room he used. Pretty cool, I think.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_2978" align="aligncenter" width="375"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09168.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2978" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09168.jpg" alt="DSC09168" width="375" height="500" /></a> The French equivalent of "George Washington slept here:" Napoleon's bedroom, and he did indeed sleep here many nights. He loved Chateau de Fontainebleau and spent many days and nights here.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_2976" align="aligncenter" width="667"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09162.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2976" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09162.jpg" alt="DSC09162" width="667" height="500" /></a> A beautiful, simple room: Marie Antoinette decorated it and it was her favorite room here.[/caption]

That's Chateau de Fontainebleau. We'd go again in a minute, and I'm sure we'll be back here again. We really love this Chateau, for its beauty and its amazing history. The Chateau was lived in by Kings Louis IX, Charles VI, Henri II and Catherine de Medici, Charles IX, Henri III, Henri IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV (The Sun King, who built Versailles), Louis XV, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Emperor Napoleon, Charles X, Louis Philippe, and Emperor Napoleon III. Not a bad cast of characters, history-wise.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After Chateau Fontainebleau we continued our week with more fancy old rooms. We love looking at these insights into the life of the rich and famous from centuries ago - don't know why, but we do.
<h2>Last Stay in Paris (sob, sniff, boo-hoo)</h2>
We will return to Paris for a day trip or two just before we leave, but this week was our last stay at Mary &amp; Gilles' apartment there. We almost chickened out, as we went to the train station in a torrential downpour, but we persevered and though it wasn't warm and sunny, at least we didn't get rained on too much.

Our first stop was at the Louvre, Wednesday evening. The Louvre stays open until 9:45 on Wednesday and Friday evenings, and that's about the only time we'll go; the place is just too crowded during the day (not that it was exactly empty at night!).

Recently the Louvre opened a new exhibit of decorative arts from the times of Louis XIV, Louis XV and Louis XVI, which covers the years from about 1670 to 1790. Decorative Arts encompass just about anything that had to do with decorating the places that people lived during those times. Of course, only the very rich could afford to decorate anything, so we end up with an insight into how the kings and queens and aristocracy lived. I think we can safely say they lived very nicely.

Not too shabby.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3000" align="aligncenter" width="667"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09180.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3000" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09180.jpg" alt="DSC09180" width="667" height="500" /></a> Looking for a gift for the person who has everything? How about a nice gold chest to store all those things?[/caption]

There are about thirty such rooms, all with furniture and art from the correct times. But you know what we liked best: the snuff boxes.

I can hear you saying, "Oh, boy, they've eaten too much cheese. Snuff boxes?" In the late 1600s and 1700s there was a huge rage to collect snuff boxes, and the exhibit had a bunch of them. They are just beautiful! Here are a few... Keep in mind that the largest of these is maybe two inches wide, and then look at the decoration on that tiny surface.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09191.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3027" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09191-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="356" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09192.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3028" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09192.jpg" alt="DSC09192" width="500" height="404" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09194.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3029" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09194-300x226.jpg" alt="DSC09194" width="500" height="376" /></a>

[caption id="attachment_3030" align="aligncenter" width="846"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09196.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3030 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09196.jpg" alt="DSC09196" width="846" height="576" /></a> The pictures on the top and front of this box are about an inch high and an inch and three-quarters wide. How did the artist get such detail into it?[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09197.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3031" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09197.jpg" alt="DSC09197" width="860" height="576" /></a>
Snuff boxes - who'd've thunk? I'd like to collect a few myself, but I can only imagine what one of these would cost, and I can guarantee that it would drastically deplete my already depleted retirement fund. (Update: I Googled "snuff boxes auction" and turned up a few nice snuff boxes with porcelain paintings, but nothing like these. Minimum bid is 5,000€ (about $5,500). Laurie says I can't place a bid.

The picture I post every year:

[caption id="attachment_3010" align="aligncenter" width="667"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09206.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3010" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09206.jpg" alt="DSC09206" width="667" height="500" /></a> Nobody goes to see the Mona Lisa; they go to take a picture of the Mona Lisa, or a selfie of them with the Mona Lisa behind them because they are <em>way</em> more important than the Mona Lisa.[/caption]

(Start of rant)
I have to say I don't get the selfie craze. It seems to me that lots of people are going to look at their pictures when they get back home and say, "There's me in front of the Eiffel Tower; there's me in front of the Mona Lisa; there's me in front something - don't know what; there's me at a café; there's me at dinner the first night; there's me at breakfast the next day; there's me on some bridge across the Seine, there's me in front of something else - don't know what..." <em>ad infinitum, ad nauseum.</em>

I know this is nothing new, but we saw thousands of people taking pictures of themselves in front of something actually interesting. Ugh. I know I'm old fashioned about this stuff (notice how many pictures on this blog have Laurie and/or me in them), but sheesh, that a person has a picture of something means they were there; is it necessary to prove it by including themselves?
(End of rant)

Maybe worse, though: I saw a woman in the Decorative Arts exhibit who walked into each room, stopped long enough to take a picture and then moved to the next room, where she repeated the process. She is going to get home and have hundreds of pictures of things she could have actually <em>seen</em> at the Louvre.
<h2>Musée Nissam de Camondo</h2>
Continuing our Old Rooms Week, we went to the Musée Nissim de Camondo the next day. This home was built in the early 1900s by Comte Moïse Camondo to house and display his best-in-the-world collection of late 1700s furnishings. He inherited a house in the rather fashionable Monceau district of Paris, <em>tore it down completely</em>, and then designed and built a huge, beautiful home very much as if it had been built at the end of the 18th century. He loved that time, and dedicated his life to building this remarkable collection. Here are two rooms (full disclosure: I swiped the first two pictures from the museum's website; photographs were not allowed, though I snuck a couple in the kitchen).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Camondo-2-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3015" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Camondo-2-2.jpg" alt="Camondo-2-2" width="864" height="576" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Camondo-1-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3014" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Camondo-1-2.jpg" alt="Camondo-1-2" width="860" height="576" /></a>

We're getting ready to do a kitchen remodel when we return, and we got some good ideas:

[caption id="attachment_3011" align="aligncenter" width="667"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09216.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3011" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09216.jpg" alt="DSC09216" width="667" height="500" /></a> Now there's a range! Four ovens and enough room to make pancakes for an army.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09220.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3012" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09220.jpg" alt="DSC09220" width="667" height="500" /></a>

Sadly, things turned out poorly for Comte de Camondo. He was forty when he married a twenty-year old woman, who gave him a son, Nissim, and a daughter, Beatrice, and then ran off with her horse trainer. When his son was killed in World War I, Moïse pretty much retired from life. He died in 1935, giving the house and his collection to France, which has maintained it since. Maybe it's good that he died before the war, because his daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren disappeared into Auschwitz and died there.

We've wanted to visit the Musée Nissim de Camodo for quite a while and I'm glad we finally got it together to do so. If you have a couple hours in Paris that you'd like to do something low-key, I recommend this place. It's an amazing look into a beautiful past.
<h2>One Last Church</h2>
There are a million churches in Paris it seems, and many are beautiful and all, we think, worth a look-see. The last thing we did was to peek into Eglise Saint Etienne du Mont, which is in the Latin Quarter. Now this church has some unusual features: the ancient tombstone of St. Genevieve, patronne saint of Paris; a bent nave (really, see the picture below), but what is most interesting is that it has the last and only jubé ("rood screen" in English) in Paris.

The jubé separates the parish congregation from the priests during a Mass. Why they needed to be separated I don't know, nor did the revolutionaries who tore them down during the French Revolution. Somehow the one at St. Etienne du Mont survived, and it is beautiful.

[caption id="attachment_3036" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09229.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3036" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09229.jpg" alt="DSC09229" width="500" height="375" /></a> The jubé - Rood screen, in English - at St. Etienne du Mont. For an unknown reason - unknown to us, anyway - it has a distinctly Islamic look to it. We've seen decorations like this in Moorish Spain.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09237.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3038" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09237.jpg" alt="DSC09237" width="375" height="500" /></a>

For you, Margaret: said to be the most beautiful organ in Paris, and who are we to argue with that?

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09233.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3037" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09233.jpg" alt="DSC09233" width="375" height="500" /></a>

The curved nave:

[caption id="attachment_3039" align="aligncenter" width="342"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09245.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3039" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09245.jpg" alt="DSC09245" width="342" height="500" /></a> This picture is aimed straight down the nave, past the altar. Note that the altar (with candles and a large pointy something), and the statue beyond it are actually in the center of where they stand. The church bends a few feet to the left past the jubé. Don't know why.[/caption]

I've got a few favorite churches in Paris, and St. Etienne du Mont joins it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most folks who know me know I love old cars and old airplanes; today I got up-close-and-personal with a classic French car, the Citroën 2CV. Last Saturday night we had a wonderful dinner; one couple there own a Citroën Deux-Chevaux and when I mentioned how much I enjoy 2CV's Helen asked if I'd like to see hers and go for a ride. Well, of course I would!

[caption id="attachment_3051" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09258.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3051 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09258.jpg" alt="DSC09258" width="768" height="576" /></a> Helen's 2CV. It's a 1978, beautifully maintained. Honestly, this car didn't look so good the day it came out of the factory.[/caption]

A little 2CV history: the "Deuche," as it's affectionately known, was thought up by the head of the Michelin Tyre Company in the 1930s and when Michelin bought the bankrupt Citroën Automobile Company, the car became a reality...almost. With great fanfare (and after over 250 different prototypes were built to test different designs), the car was announced in 1939. The next day, France declared war on Germany and World War II started. Production was, quite understandably, postponed.

The first real production 2CV rolled out of the factory in 1948. What does the "2CV" name mean: "deux-chevaux," - two horsepower -, of course; the output of the 2CV's two-cylinder engine. Now that two horsepower rating was by a different standard than American cars; by American standards, the engine produced a whopping 9 horsepower.

[caption id="attachment_3054" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09263.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3054 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09263.jpg" alt="DSC09263" width="768" height="576" /></a> The 2Cv's engine. In fact, the 2CV's engine and transmission, all in a package about 18 inches long. By the time this car was built, output was up to 33 horsepower by American measurement standards.[/caption]

The design philosophy was pure minimalist: the goal was to keep the car simple, light, easy to maintain, and cheap.

[caption id="attachment_3052" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09260.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3052 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09260.jpg" alt="DSC09260" width="768" height="576" /></a> Simple: steering wheel check; gearshift, check; seats, check. Other options, nope. This car has nice checked seat-covers; the original 2CV had a canvas sling seat, like a beach chair.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3053" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09261.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3053 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09261.jpg" alt="DSC09261" width="768" height="576" /></a> Automatic door opener, 2CV-style. You turn the knob and the door opens. Simple. Always works.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09268.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3056" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09268.jpg" alt="DSC09268" width="768" height="576" /></a>

After a good walk-around, we were off. <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09287.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3059" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09287.jpg" alt="DSC09287" width="768" height="576" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09283.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3058" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09283.jpg" alt="DSC09283" width="768" height="576" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09275.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3057" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09275.jpg" alt="DSC09275" width="768" height="576" /></a>

I gotta tell you, this car is noisy. My old MGs were whisper-quiet compared. But geeze this was fun! I couldn't stop grinning: we were in real piece of French automobile history.

Believe it or not, this car was an sales immediate success with the French. Within two years, there was a five-year waiting list to buy one. And also believe it or not, its success continued: the Deuche holds the record for longest-produced car. It was built in France from 1948 to 1987: 39 years! (It was built in Portugal for another two years, adding to its longevity record.)

Putting her life in my hands, Helen asked if I wanted to drive. Well, of course I wanted to drive. I'm not sure Laurie, riding in the back, was so sure about this, but off we went. Neck-snapping acceleration was not present, and as Helen pointed out, you have to plan your braking because brakes are not a strong point. I've driven trucks with lighter steering, and the driver does a lot of steering because the Deuche kind of wanders around the road a bit. But I loved it!

[caption id="attachment_3060" align="aligncenter" width="432"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09294.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3060 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09294.jpg" alt="DSC09294" width="432" height="576" /></a> I fit, but barely. The seats are adjustable by unbolting them from the floor and bolting them back into the position you want.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09295.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3063" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09295.jpg" alt="DSC09295" width="500" height="375" /></a>

Over the years I've taken many photos of 2Cv's because - for whatever reason - I love them. They represent a France that doesn't exist anymore, and they represent a style of car that isn't built anymore. They are ungainly, quirky, funny-looking in this day of sleek cars, but they are honest, authentic automobiles - classics. If we were to move here, I'd have one in a minute!

Many thanks to Helen, here with Laurie, for sharing her ride with me. I'll have a different perspective on every Deuche I see now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My favorite book of this trip is "<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large">Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation: A History of Literary Paris in the Twenties and Thirties" by Noël Riley Fitch. Sylvia Beach was, of course, the owner of that famous English bookstore in Paris, Shakespeare &amp; Company. The book details the lives of Sylvia and her bookstore during the 20s and 30s, when Paris was the home of the "Lost Generation"of English-language writers: Hemingway, of course, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Ezra Pound, and many, many others.</span>

What I didn't realize until I read this book was how important Sylvia Beach was to this time and place. She provided a place for all these authors to meet and get to know each other and work together and read each others' work. She encouraged many, often loaning them money to get through tough financial times. And, of course, she published James Joyce's Ulysses, against lots of advice. She was instrumental in the development and later success of many, if not most, of America's early-20th century writers.

Now, most Americans of a literary bent will stop by the current Shakespeare &amp; Company on Rue de la Bûcherie, across the Seine from Notre Dame.:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/300px-Shakespeare_and_Company_store_in_Paris.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3090" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/300px-Shakespeare_and_Company_store_in_Paris.jpg" alt="300px-Shakespeare_and_Company_store_in_Paris" width="400" height="300" /></a>
In 1951 George Whitman wanted to open a bookstore in Paris. Somehow, he met Sylvia Beach, who still lived in the city, though Shakespeare &amp; Company had been closed by the Nazis in 1941. At dinner, Sylvia said George could use the name -or so he said - and he opened a bookstore at the current location and has since encouraged writers there, with a place to sleep in exchange for working in the store. Though it has the name, it has no direct lineage back to the real Shakespeare &amp; Company.

I decided to look up the locations of the real Shakespeare &amp; Co. Sylvia opened the first store in 1921 at 8, rue Dupuytren; today, it looks like this:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09322.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3086" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09322.jpg" alt="DSC09322" width="768" height="576" /></a>

Not a word about its history!

Sylvia moved Shakespeare &amp; Co. around the corner to 12, rue de l'Odeon about 18 months later. This was a larger location, and across the street from the French-language bookstore of Adrienne Monnier, Sylvia's life-long love.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09326.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3089" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09326.jpg" alt="DSC09326" width="768" height="576" /></a>

This location has a reference to its history; the plaque between the two upper windows:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09254.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3085" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC09254.jpg" alt="DSC09254" width="698" height="576" /></a>

Not a word about the location's center of English writers for twenty years, but at least Sylvia gets a mention for publishing Ulysses here.

After the Nazis closed Shakespeare &amp; Co. in 1941, Sylvia remained in Paris - she was the first person Hemingway visited after he liberated Paris (in his always-humble opinion) in 1944. She died in 1962, in the apartment above the rue de l'Odeon site of Shakespeare &amp; Company.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're back in the good old US of A and visiting Craig and Annie and Clara and the newest Zumsteg, Henry. This is totally fun, and makes leaving France easier. Without further blather, here're some pictures.
<h2>Clara's birthday</h2>
Clara celebrated her 5th birthday on September 20, so we brought an extended birthday celebration for her. Craig and Annie said that Clara had coveted a role-playing kit, in this case a Hair Dresser's outfit - yes, really. So we gave her that and it was a hit!

First, on with the outfit.

[caption id="attachment_3109" align="aligncenter" width="375"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09430.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3109" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09430.jpg" alt="DSC09430" width="375" height="500" /></a> Grandma helping Clara show off her birthday present from us.[/caption]

Then, of course, everybody had to get their hair cut. This was, to say the least, a riot!

[caption id="attachment_3110" align="aligncenter" width="375"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09435.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3110" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09435.jpg" alt="DSC09435" width="375" height="500" /></a> Grandma was up first.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3115" align="aligncenter" width="375"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09526.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3115" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09526.jpg" alt="DSC09526" width="375" height="500" /></a> At first, Clara was pretty serious about her work...[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3111" align="aligncenter" width="608"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09453.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3111" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09453.jpg" alt="DSC09453" width="608" height="500" /></a> Do not - really, do not - ask or comment on Granddad getting his haircut. Clara seemed to think it was slightly humorous. Granddad was not so sure...[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3112" align="aligncenter" width="667"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09455.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3112" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09455.jpg" alt="DSC09455" width="667" height="500" /></a> Clara's problem cutting Craig's hair was that there wasn't much to cut.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3113" align="aligncenter" width="375"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09460.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3113" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09460.jpg" alt="DSC09460" width="375" height="500" /></a> Annie's turn in the barrel...[/caption]

Phew, we all survived, but amazingly enough, Clara decided the next night that we all needed haircuts again. I'm going to be bald by the time I get home.
<h2>And...announcing Henry George Zumsteg!</h2>
Henry was born August 12, so he is seven weeks old. He is the smilingest seven week old kid I've ever seen. All you have to do is smile at him and he grins right back. Here's Henry:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09529.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3117" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09529.jpg" alt="DSC09529" width="768" height="576" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09535.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3118" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09535.jpg" alt="DSC09535" width="768" height="576" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09538.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3119" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09538.jpg" alt="DSC09538" width="768" height="576" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09545.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3120" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09545.jpg" alt="DSC09545" width="768" height="576" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09528.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3116" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC09528.jpg" alt="DSC09528" width="768" height="576" /></a>

It has been nothing but fun to see Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry. I could post another 300-400 pictures, but I think that might bore a few people.

Tomorrow we head back to Seattle, about 145 days after we left. We like these long vacations; might do it again next year...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, we are heading off to France again this summer, so stay tuned and I'll post updates on what we're doing. We'll be gone a shorter time this year: three months in France, and five days coming and going in New York, visiting Craig and Annie and getting serious grandkid-squeezing time with Clara and Henry. Our basic time-line:

May 29 - off to New York
June 3 - New York to Paris (again on my favorite airplane, the gigantic Airbus A380)
September 3 - back to New York
September 9 - back to Seattle

We're vagabonds this year, doing more moving around that we'd like, but what the heck, it's moving around in France and that's not all bad. We'll make rambles to Bordeaux, where we've never been (we hear they have wine there), and the small town of Monpazier and Cahors, then house-sit for the month of July in Samois-sur-Seine, where we were last summer. In July we'll also return to our favorite town in France (and maybe our favorite town in the world), La Rochelle, then a few days in the Dordogne Valley. In August we'll stay in Brittany for a week, visiting the town of Dinan for a few days, and renewing our love affair with Saint-Pierre-Quiberon. We hope to be able to visit Paris a few times, too; we've said that there's something very cool about trying to plan an upcoming week or two and having "let's go into Paris for a few days" as one of the options.

That's Summer, 2016 for <em>les Zumsteg</em>. I can set you up to receive an email when I post something, so leave a comment or send me an email (john@zumsteg.us) if you'd like me to do that.

À bientôt!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First, the update: the European news agency Reuters reports that the French air traffic controllers have called off their strike this weekend. We haven't seen any corroboration of that and until I see it on the Air France site, I won't be 100% convinced, but at least there's some hint of good news.

In the meantime, Grandkid Pics! After all, that's what you're here for, is it not?

Clara's Daisy Girl troop was at the Memorial Day Parade which, because of nasty weather, was held in the local fire station.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We made it, safely and soundly! The flight over was fine: left on time, the meal was actually tasty (not unusual on Air France), we arrived on time, contacted the car-lease company without a problem, a van came to pick us up, the car was ready (bright red, our favorite color for a car), and the drive to Bois-le-Rois uneventful. The only hitch was arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport and seeing a loooooooooooooong line for passport control. I guessed it at 90 minutes, but then another section opened up and it was only 50 minutes. The most frustrating part: there were twenty stations available - two passport officer positions per station - and exactly half of them were staffed. This with way more than a thousand people in line and more arriving every minute. Oh, well, at least we knew we wouldn't have to wait for our luggage.

Last week in New York we kept hearing disturbing news from France: strikers had closed six of eight refineries, so gas was not going to be available; the air traffic controllers were going on strike the weekend we were to travel, and the Seine was flooding. In the event, getting gas is no problem; the French government evidently bought-off the controllers, and the Seine didn't quite flood Paris. But the river is the highest it's been in decades, and many up-river towns are, indeed, underwater. We crossed the Seine in Melun and could not believe how high it was.

So after a fine "welcome back" breakfast <em>chez Germain</em>, we walked down to the locks on the Seine at Chartrettes. We've seen the river high, but this was jaw-dropping.

The lock requires a dam that generally lowers the river about 12-15 feet between the levels above and below the lock. Saturday there was no drop, at all. Below, you see water running out of the main lock at Chartrettes.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3180" rel="attachment wp-att-3180"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3180" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09930.jpg" alt="Main Lock at Chartrettes" width="864" height="648" /></a>

Below, looking upstream from a bridge across the lock. Normally, the area from the right side to the fence along the left is above water; the level in the lock at its highest is about five feet below what you see here. The locks are, of course, not operating and the water is flowing over the lock gates at both ends.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3177" rel="attachment wp-att-3177"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3177" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09918.jpg" alt="DSC09918" width="864" height="648" /></a>

The Seine here flows at about 2-3 miles per hour normally. Saturday I estimated it at about 15 miles per hour. So what you have is a river fifteen feet above normal level, traveling five times faster than normal, flooding banks on both sides, heading toward Paris, where it will join the Marne river - not as high, but way above normal - and enter Paris, where the Seine narrows to about two-thirds the width you see here. In Paris, the Seine peaked at about 20 feet above normal, flooding all the quai's and closing the Louvre and d'Orsay museums, which are both next to the river. I saw a photo of the main floor of the d'Orsay, with about two feet of water in it.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3178" rel="attachment wp-att-3178"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3178" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09924.jpg" alt="DSC09924" width="864" height="648" /></a>

In the beautiful town of Samois-sur-Seine, where some people probably wished that the "sur-Seine" part of the name wasn't so literal:

[caption id="attachment_3181" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3181" rel="attachment wp-att-3181"><img class="size-full wp-image-3181" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09950.jpg" alt="Sometimes river-front property is not so great..." width="864" height="648" /></a> Sometimes river-front property is not so great...[/caption]

But the boaters enjoyed exploring what is usually dry ground:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3179" rel="attachment wp-att-3179"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3179" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09929.jpg" alt="DSC09929" width="864" height="648" /></a>

The strongest impression of all this is just how freaking powerful water is when it's out of control. Nothing anyone could do was going to slow this river down or keep it from damaging whatever was in its way. Amazing.

Fortunately, the rains have stopped and the river level is dropping. Sunday we walked to the locks and saw that the level was down about a foot or foot and a half. Still, it will be days before the river traffic can start again; there's no way a river barge could go up this river, and going down it would be out of control and at the mercy of the currents most of the time. Our péniche-watching will have to wait a week or so.

Anyway, we are glad to be back in France!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We walked to the Chartrettes lock yesterday to see how things were progressing. Answer: getting better. The Seine is down by six-eight feet below the locks and much of the surrounding banks that were under a lot of water Saturday are now dry. Some comparisons:

This is looking at the locks last Saturday:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3177" rel="attachment wp-att-3177"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3177" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09918.jpg" alt="DSC09918" width="864" height="648" /></a>

Yesterday we could actually see the locks. On Saturday, the areas along beside the lock and the grassy area were under about six inches of water.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3195" rel="attachment wp-att-3195"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3195" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09971.jpg" alt="DSC09971" width="864" height="648" /></a>

Boaters enjoying new areas to explore Saturday:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3179" rel="attachment wp-att-3179"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3179" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09929.jpg" alt="DSC09929" width="864" height="648" /></a>Back to dry(-ish) ground yesterday:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3196" rel="attachment wp-att-3196"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3196" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09973.jpg" alt="DSC09973" width="864" height="648" /></a>

We're guessing another four or five days before the river barges start to operate again; the river is still running so fast that a barge would have a hard time. So many of them are holed up in St. Mammès, which is kind of the headquarters of the Seine River barges (pèniches).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3200" rel="attachment wp-att-3200"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3200" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09979.jpg" alt="DSC09979" width="864" height="648" /></a>

The pèniches made it through the flood far better than did many residents of St. Mammès. The water level reached about five feet above ground level of the houses nearest the rivers (Seine and Loing). Today we saw many houses with piles of water-logged junk in front waiting to be hauled away.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year I posted some meanderings about our current home of Bois-le-Roi, so just a few notes here. Bois-le-Roi is about 35 minutes by train south of Paris, with a population of about 5,600.

Our "home away from home" in Bois-le-Roi:

Here is an example of one thing that fascinates us about France: we went for a walk with our friend Mary yesterday. We walked a little bit into the forest that surrounds Bois-le-Roi and came upon these two stones, about a half mile apart:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3212" rel="attachment wp-att-3212"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3212" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09982.jpg" alt="DSC09982" width="350" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3213" rel="attachment wp-att-3213"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3213" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC09983.jpg" alt="DSC09983" width="360" /></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
What's fascinating is that no one knows what they are, when they were placed there, nor why. The one of the left has "778" carved into it; the one on the right "777." Maybe they marked the boundary of the forest, but no one knows. Gotta love a real-life mystery, don't you? Mary says there are many of these markers in the area.

That's a quick look at our current digs. We really like this town, a typical small French town; nothing special, really, but still...special to us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We made our first foray into Paris this week - went in Monday morning and just returned (Wednesday afternoon). Paris is Paris; we're always so glad to be back in the city.

One motivator for coming in this time is that the Fondacion le Corbusier gives a tour in English on Tuesdays, and we really wanted to be there for that. Since few people outside us architectural crazies know who Le Corbusier was, a few words...

Born Charles-Édouard Jeanneret in Switzerland in 1887, he took the professional name of <em>le Corbusier</em> in 1920; at that time it was common for professionals to take a pseudonym. Mostly, he wanted to be a painter and founded a school of painting he called Purism. Though he dedicated himself to Purism, only he and one other painter really adopted it, and for good reason: it isn't very interesting.

But his ideas for buildings were interesting from the start. For some time, I was disdainful of <em>le Corbusier</em> for one reason: I read an article about his 1920s plan for Paris: he wanted to raze the city from the river north and build 40-story apartment buildings, with subterranean streets and lots of park areas. That idea of razing half the most beautiful city in the world rankled badly. Then...last trip we visited the Museum of Architecture in Paris (a not-well-known and wonderful museum) and in it is a apartment unit from a building <em>le Corbusier</em> designed and built for workmen in Marseille. It is simply a marvel. It is small, efficient and pleasing from any point-of-view in the apartment. As I have a biding interest in affordable housing, this fascinated me, and fortunately the museum had a number of other exhibits on Corbu. I bought a small book on him and started reading up.

After all this, I learned that the Fondacion le Cobusier, which is located in one half of a building he designed in the 16th Arrondissement of Paris, had just added an English-language tour one day a week. So, we were there for the tour last Tuesday. It was beautiful.

First, here's a picture of a building built just a few years before Maison la Roche, the <em>le Corbusier</em> building we visited, was designed and constructed:

[caption id="attachment_3229" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3229" rel="attachment wp-att-3229"><img class="wp-image-3229 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00095.jpg" alt="A house near le Corbusier's Maison la Roche. Probably a close contemporary of Maison la Roche, built in the late 1880s or early 1900s. Maison la Roche was built1923-1925." width="864" height="597" /></a> A house near <em>le Corbusier's</em> Maison la Roche. Probably a close contemporary of Maison la Roche, built in the late 1880s or early 1900s. Maison la Roche was built 1923-1925.[/caption]

Here's the building we saw yesterday, designed and built between 1923 and 1925:

[caption id="attachment_3234" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3234" rel="attachment wp-att-3234"><img class="wp-image-3234 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00093.jpg" alt="This is actually two living units, separated at where you see two garage doors. On the left was the home and exhibition rooms for Raoul Albert La Roche, a supporter of le Corbusier's Purist movement (about the only supporter) and on the right the home of le Corbusier's brother." width="864" height="648" /></a> This is actually two living units, separated at where you see two garage doors. On the left was the home and exhibition rooms for Raoul Albert La Roche, a supporter of <em>le Corbusier's</em> Purist movement (about the only supporter) and on the right the home of <em>le Corbusier'</em>s brother.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3233" rel="attachment wp-att-3233"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3233 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00090.jpg" alt="DSC00090" width="864" height="590" /></a>

Do you notice a difference between Maison la Roche and the first building shown? Both are, in my (always) humble opinion, beautiful buildings, but in completely different ways.

One of Corbu's architectural design philosophies was the architecture of a building should reveal itself to a person as he or she walked into and through a building. As we toured Maison La Roche, different views opened up and, for me, at least, every one of them was beautiful. It seemed to me that no matter where I looked, the spaces I saw were beautiful, of perfect form. Here are a couple pictures from Maison La Roche:

[caption id="attachment_3231" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3231" rel="attachment wp-att-3231"><img class="wp-image-3231 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00070.jpg" alt="The exhibition room of M.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3232" rel="attachment wp-att-3232"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3232" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00080.jpg" alt="DSC00080" width="450" height="600" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3238" rel="attachment wp-att-3238"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3238" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00071.jpg" alt="DSC00071" width="450" height="600" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3239" rel="attachment wp-att-3239"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3239 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00074.jpg" alt="DSC00074" width="864" height="625" /></a>I haven't made it clear that <em>le Corbusier</em> was likely the most influential architect of the twentieth century.  The break you see between the first building and his style drove architecture into the Modern era, where it continues today. Now, not all buildings are as beautiful as his; I can easily find Parisian atrocities that evolved from Modernist architecture. But <em>le Corbu</em> surely was a visionary and the world is better for his vision (I think).

Okay, enough about <em>le Corbusier.</em> Suffice it to say that I've become a fan.

Now, to finish up the day and this post... We went to dinner with Mary and Gilles, where we met their son Eric, who we know well. Dinner was great, with excellent food and wine and conversation. When dessert time came, I ordered rice pudding because, well, I like rice pudding. It arrived in a humongous pot. The picture below is <strong><em>after</em></strong> I had eaten a rather large portion; the pot was completely filled when it arrive<em> á table</em>.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3236" rel="attachment wp-att-3236"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3236" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0780.jpg" alt="IMG_0780" width="413" height="550" /></a>

Now that's what I call a rice pudding! Even with help from Mary and Laurie, I couldn't eat more than a third of it. I want to point out, though, that it was fantastic; certainly one of the best rice puddings I've ever had. Unfortunately, "doggy bags" are a no-no in France, so I had to leave a lot of it. Can't wait to go back, though; I'm skipping the first and second courses and going straight to the rice pudding.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we drove with Mary and Gilles to Sancerre, about an hour and a half south of Bois-le-Roi. The motivation for making this trip was simple: buy some Sancerre wine from a small winery that we know and appreciate. So off we went.

<strong>The Town of Sancerre</strong>

Sancerre is a small and pretty hilltop town.

[caption id="attachment_3260" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3260" rel="attachment wp-att-3260"><img class="size-full wp-image-3260" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00107.jpg" alt="Looking at the hills of grapes from Sancerre." width="864" height="648" /></a> Looking at the hills of grapes from Sancerre.[/caption]

It is also a dying hilltop town. If it weren't for the area's famous white wines, I suspect Sancerre would have been a ghost town long ago. Now, it's set up to handle tourists who come to try-and-buy the wines, and I suspect July and August see Sancerre crowded. But a rainy June weekday, not so much.

[caption id="attachment_3261" align="aligncenter" width="397"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3261" rel="attachment wp-att-3261"><img class="wp-image-3261" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00108.jpg" alt="Beautiful street, but empty of people." width="397" height="550" /></a> Beautiful street, but empty of people.[/caption]

The weather has, so far this trip, been, oh, "crappy" might describe it. Today was more of the same, though we did have some sun breaks...

[caption id="attachment_3265" align="aligncenter" width="413"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3265" rel="attachment wp-att-3265"><img class="wp-image-3265" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00121.jpg" alt="Oh-oh, that sky looks awfully dark..." width="413" height="550" /></a> Oh-oh, that sky looks awfully dark...[/caption]

&nbsp;

Oh, well, time to go get some wine, after a stop for lunch and to buy some cheese.

Then it was on to our favorite little winery down here. This picture shows why we call it the anti-Napa winery:

How much did we buy?

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3271" rel="attachment wp-att-3271"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3271" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00148.jpg" alt="DSC00148" width="864" height="648" /></a>

Lots.

When we were here in 2013, we wanted to go try some Sancerre, because in several Chief Inspector Maigret books the Chief Inspector drinks Sancerre. We were on a trip to the neighboring city of Bourges so we came to Sancerre region and tried some. I have to tell you, it was an epiphany for us previously-not-white-wine-drinkers. We love this wine, and it opened up the world of white wines to us. We have tried many since and though Chablis has gained on it, Sancerre remains our favorite white wine and one of our favorite wines, period. A lovely, crisp Sauvignon Blanc wine.

<strong>Gien</strong>

On the way home we stopped at Gien, famous for its faience - glazed ceramic ware. We stopped at a place that sells "Deuxieme Choix" (seconds), and discontinued lines. Even at that, this stuff is seriously expensive. I liked best an espresso cup/saucer combination, at about $50. Didn't spring for it. Given those prices, you can guess what this table setting cost:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3272" rel="attachment wp-att-3272"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3272" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00150.jpg" alt="DSC00150" width="864" height="657" /></a>

My SWAG: somewhere in the $5,000 - $7,000 range. Didn't spring for that, either.

A nice day. Returned with lots of wine and more good memories. What could be better?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years ago I wrote about parking in France. It has not changed. My conclusion about parking in France is that a driver can park a car anywhere as long as 1) the car doesn't block traffic or a pedestrian crosswalk; and 2) the driver puts the blinkers on. In fact, I think in many cases the driver can ignore rule 1 if he or she obeys rule 2.

I will post pictures of cars illustrating one or both rules as I see them. For now, the subject is the parking lot at the Bois-le-Roi train station.

Parking is, oh, "limited" here. In fact, some drivers park a mile away and walk to the station; always a pleasure in the weather we've been having. So any tiny patch of open ground in the actual parking lot is fair game, as shown in the pictures below.

<h2>Clio</h2>
On another subject, here's our ride for this trip:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3308" rel="attachment wp-att-3308"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3308" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0766.jpg" alt="IMG_0766" width="864" height="648" /></a>

This is a Renault Clio 4, the same as we've had the last couple trips; this time we even got it in our favorite car color. We really like this car and wish Renault would export it to the United States. If anyone is interested in the nitty-gritty, we do a short-term lease with Renault. On a short-term lease, the cost is pretty high for the first 21 days (something like $49 per day), then drops to $15 per day after. Our average cost for the 91 days we're here: $22.09 per day. That's for a brand-new (4 km at delivery) car with GPS, fully insured, including roadside assistance. Pretty hard to beat that deal, I can tell you. If you ever need a car for more than three or four weeks, this is the way to go. We get the car through RenaultUSA (http://www.renaultusa.com). It is absolutely painless, but if you run into a problem during the leasing process, the RenaultUSA folks are great to work with. Their office is in Elmsford, New York, the small town where Craig and Annie live, and we stopped in to see them when we were in New York. Great folks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been on a ramble for the last week, and I've been remiss in posting about it. The first week has been in the Bordeaux region: two days in the Pauillac area, two days in Bordeaux itself, and two days in Fronsac, near the famous wine town of St. Emilion. We've had great weather and excellent adventures.
<h2>Pauillac.</h2>
I won't write a lot about Pauillac, as we were there a short time in a less-than-memorable B &amp; B. Actually, I should say it was quite memorable, but not in a positive way. Best thing was that the woman running it (born in Aberdeen, WA - 90 minutes from Seattle) knew the wine-makers in the area and set us up with appointments at a couple. We did enjoy the wine-tasting - no surprise there. Pauillac wines are made with what's thought of as the "traditional" Bordeaux blend: mostly cabernet sauvignon with a fair amount of merlot and small amounts of petit meunier and cabernet franc. Nice wines... We had some at a large chateau (the wine makers here are called "chateau" even though they are unlikely to have a physical chateau building anywhere) and a very small place. Prices were large and small, respectively, but all the wines we tasted were excellent, matching their prices to their quality.
<h2>Bordeaux</h2>
Bordeaux is an ancient city, existing long before Rome conquered it in 60 BC. Its golden age was in the 18th century and during that time many beautiful buildings were constructed of a golden limestone. For whatever reason, the years since did not result in those buildings being destroyed as in so many cities. The got tired and dirty, but they remained. Over the last couple decades, Bordeaux has cleaned and restored many of these buildings, pedestrianized many downtown streets, and built an excellent tram system that makes getting into and around the city quick, easy and cheap. To say we liked Bordeaux understates how we feel: we are looking forward to returning already.

Both readers of this blog know we like beautiful buildings. You can imagine, then, how we felt when we first stepped into this street:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3333" rel="attachment wp-att-3333"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3333" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00326.jpg" alt="DSC00326" width="864" height="523" /></a>

Most of Bordeaux's central core has streets like this! Walking around the city is a treat for us building aficionados. Some more:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3341" rel="attachment wp-att-3341"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3341" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00380.jpg" alt="DSC00380" width="864" height="613" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3346" rel="attachment wp-att-3346"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3346" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00407.jpg" alt="DSC00407" width="864" height="619" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3345" rel="attachment wp-att-3345"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3345" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00406.jpg" alt="DSC00406" width="864" height="569" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3343" rel="attachment wp-att-3343"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3343" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00390.jpg" alt="DSC00390" width="864" height="625" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3337" rel="attachment wp-att-3337"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3337" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00353.jpg" alt="DSC00353" width="864" height="648" /></a>

It's not perfect, though. You may recall that in my Le Corbusier post I mentioned that there's a lot of UGLY modern architecture; Exhibit 1:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3340" rel="attachment wp-att-3340"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3340" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00374.jpg" alt="DSC00374" width="864" height="614" /></a>

This is essentially a Court House. It is slammed against a beautiful tower left from the city's protective wall; no one can explain what those cone things are or the wavy roof. One explanation said that its openness is to symbolize the "transparency of justice." Right. This is one ugly building, surrounded by beautiful buildings 250 years older. The one bright spot, as Mary pointed out, is that it will be gone long before that wall tower disappears. The tower has been there centuries; I can only hope the building doesn't last that long.
<h2>La Cité du Vin</h2>
Are you surprised that Bordeaux - one center of France's wonderful wines - would have a wine museum? In fact, it has at least two; one of which is brand new and shows what modern architecture can be. This is a spectacular building (in my always humble opinion).<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3347" rel="attachment wp-att-3347"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3347" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00320.jpg" alt="DSC00320" width="864" height="648" /></a>

The exhibits of the museum use technology to explain the history of wine, how it's made and how to appreciate it. When we bought our tickets (not cheap: $22 each) we were told to plan for two hours to see it; after two hours we had not seen everything but we were, indeed, finished. So we went to the observation room at the top where we were able to try a glass of wine (part of the admission fee) and look over the city. From there it's possible to see the rebuilding of this previously derelict area of Bordeaux; the museum has generated a renaissance here, and in a few years it will be surrounded with new buildings and apartments.

That's Bordeaux. We are already planning to return. We loved the city.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After we left Bordeaux, we drove to the rather smallish town of Fronsac (population: 300). Fronsac is near the famous wine-growing region of St. Emilion, home of some of the finest (and highest priced) wines in the world. Here we stayed at a Bed and Breakfast that could serve as the model for all B&amp;Bs: it was just wonderful. More on that later...
<h2>St. Emilion</h2>
We'd heard much about how beautiful the town of St.Emilion is: on a hilltop, overlooking vineyards, wonderful streets to wander about, etc., etc. True, true and not so true. St. Emilion realized someday not too long ago that there was money not just in wine, but in catering to all the tourists and so it gussied itself up for them. The result is that, for me at least, the town of St. Emilion is too pretty, too cute and too touristy. I overheard a couple comments that sum it up: an English woman in a tour group, asking her guide, "Do these stores take credit cards?" Do they ever... And another group of young women discussing their afternoon schedule and concluding, "That means we have an hour to shop before we have to do anything."

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3367" rel="attachment wp-att-3367"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3367" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00463.jpg" alt="DSC00463" width="375" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3368" rel="attachment wp-att-3368"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3368" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00464.jpg" alt="DSC00464" width="375" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3369" rel="attachment wp-att-3369"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3369" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00465.jpg" alt="DSC00465" width="375" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3370" rel="attachment wp-att-3370"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3370" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC00467.jpg" alt="DSC00467" width="375" height="500" /></a>

St. Emilion does have some good things to see. The best I cannot show, as pictures were not allowed. It's an underground church, carved out of the stone that makes up the hill on which St. Emilion sits. This is no small church: 40 yards long, 30 yards wide and 40 ft high. It was started sometime around the end of the 11th century or start of the 12th and was completed in something like 50 years. 15,000 cubic meters of rock were removed to make it. It is yuuuuuge!

St. Emilion does offer some beautiful sights...

But Fronsac has something that makes it worthwhile for any visitor to this area: Le Clos d'Iris - a simply wonderful bed and breakfast. Coming from me - a long-time B&amp;B curmudgeon - that is high praise. We loved staying here! What other bed and breakfast has owners who invite you to share wine and aperitifs with them in their beautiful garden? What other bed and breakfast has owners who, when they meet guests in a nearby restaurant, share their wedding anniversary bottle of wine with the guests and talk with them about life, the universe and everything in Fronsac. Well, that's Joëlle and Regis, hosts of Le Clos d'Iris.

Many homemade items, everything delicious, beautifully presented.[/caption]

Now, I know that not many of you are planning on heading off to Fronsac in the near future, but if you want to visit the area around St. Emilion and try its wines, or if you know anyone else who is heading in that direction, Clos d'Iris is a great place to make the center of your explorations. Check it out at www.leclosdiris.com.
<h2>Wine Buying</h2>
Our hosts sent us to a winery for a bit of tasting. At the winery, they were bottling one of their wines.

Yes, done by a portable bottling facility on a truck. The equipment to bottle wine is not cheap, and few wineries have the need to buy it. Most wineries, including high-end ones, bottle their wines using a truck like this.[/caption]

The wines were great, and not very expensive, especially compared to a similar-quality Napa wine. We bought a little:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eight years ago we came to Monpazier and have wanted to return ever since. We were able to arrange it this year and we are so glad we did. This is an amazing town, with quite a history, situated in the beautiful Lot River valley.

First, a bit of history. For centuries, England controlled quite a lot of what is now France, a result of Eleanor of Acquitaine marrying the future king of England and bringing the lands she inherited from her father. This was kind of okay until 1337 when Edward III of England got ticked off at Philip IV of France and re-asserted his claim to the French throne. The war was fought off and on until 1453 (so it really should be the One Hundred and Sixteen Year War) when France kicked England out of the country for good. (This is <em>way</em> simplified; French/English history buffs are invited to expand and correct in the comments section. Please keep such expansions/corrections to 20,000 words or less.)

What's all this got to do with Monpazier? During the war, both sides built <em>bastide</em> towns - England more than France. These towns were built along whatever the border was at the time, and were designed and built to make them easy to defend. So at a time when most villages and towns were a hodge-podge of crooked, narrow streets, the <em>bastide</em> towns were rectangular, with straight, wide streets that made it easy to move troops from one side to another as a battle progressed. There are a number of these <em>bastide</em> towns remaining, and Monpazier is the best preserved by far.

Here's a look down a main street of Monpazier:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3437" rel="attachment wp-att-3437"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3437" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00656.jpg" alt="DSC00656" width="375" height="500" /></a>

Wide and straight. Take away the cars and you've got a <em>bastide</em> town of 700 years ago.

Monpazier also has about my favorite main square in the world. Here's a panoramic  view of it, showing about 2-1/2 sides of the square.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3425" rel="attachment wp-att-3425"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3425" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00579-2.jpg" alt="DSC00579-2" width="864" height="196" /></a>

And some pictures of the different sides.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3424" rel="attachment wp-att-3424"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3424" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00578-2.jpg" alt="DSC00578-2" width="864" height="648" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3423" rel="attachment wp-att-3423"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3423" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00577.jpg" alt="DSC00577" width="864" height="655" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3422" rel="attachment wp-att-3422"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3422" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00575.jpg" alt="DSC00575" width="864" height="648" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3421" rel="attachment wp-att-3421"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3421" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00574.jpg" alt="DSC00574" width="864" height="648" /></a>

The <em>bastide</em> towns almost always have arcaded buildings on the square.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3428" rel="attachment wp-att-3428"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3428" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00584.jpg" alt="DSC00584" width="864" height="648" /></a>

And many of the <em>bastide</em> towns have their original market hall; here's Monpazier's.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3427" rel="attachment wp-att-3427"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3427" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00583.jpg" alt="DSC00583" width="864" height="579" /></a>

The population of Monpazier is about 500 people, though the area around it has probably another 500. An oddity is that many of the houses in town are owned by Brits, who love the whole Dordogne and Lot River valley areas. Most of the tourists here were Brits. We found that during the day Monpazier was populated by tourists - this surprised us, as memories of that first visit do not include many tourists, British or otherwise. But we found that in the evening the tourists left (there are only about 30 hotel rooms in the town and half a dozen <em>chambre-d'hote</em> rooms), and Monpazier returned to looking a lot as it did 500 years ago.

Some other pictures of Monpazier:

We like Monpazier, not least because the hotel we stay in here is beautiful, with a way-above-average restaurant. Here's Laurie looking out the "tower room" of our room.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3439" rel="attachment wp-att-3439"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3439" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00667.jpg" alt="DSC00667" width="375" height="500" /></a>I have little doubt that we will come back here. One reason is Monpazier, another is that the Lot River valley is beautiful, but that's the subject of the next post.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monpazier sits in the Lot River valley, a beautiful area. Most Americans visiting France keep themselves to the Paris area, or maybe Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. These are big cities, and so those tourists never see and enjoy rural France. In fact, much of France is rural, and much of that rural France is beautiful. In both our Monpazier visits we've taken long, slow drives through the area and have found it to be a wonderful look at a France most tourists miss.

Our first trip here (eight years ago) we drove into the country-side and, at one point, saw a sign with an arrow and what appeared to be a route name. We continued to follow the arrows and entered Villareal, a town not far from Monpazier. A stop at the Office of Tourism solved the mystery: there are four routes for bikers drawn up for this area. They follow small backroads and are from 25 to 40 miles long. This trip, we went straight to that tourist office and bought two of the maps (for a whole $1.10 each) and set off. What follows are pictures from our two trips through the countryside. We finished neither route, averaged about 15 miles per hour, and loved every minute.

[caption id="attachment_3463" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3463" rel="attachment wp-att-3463"><img class="wp-image-3463 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00683.jpg" alt="DSC00683" width="864" height="196" /></a> Get outside the cities and towns and this is what you'll see.[/caption]

Every city, town, village and wide spot in the road where someone lives has a monument to the soldiers from that place who died in World War I and World War II. Both are heart-breaking, World War I also being jaw-dropping. In that war, France lost 1.4 million soldiers - almost 5% of its population, and somewhere around 30% of its men of marriageable age.  (The United States lost 0.13% of its population in that war and 0.32% in World War 2.) That France recovered is, to me, a miracle. In our walks around these rural towns and villages, we always stop at the monument to pay our respects.

To give you an idea of the magnitude of the World War I losses, here is the parish church for a small town; you can see how small it is. The town and area around it has maybe 50 houses and farms.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3458" rel="attachment wp-att-3458"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3458" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00619.jpg" alt="DSC00619" width="864" height="648" /></a>

Here is the monument outside the church to losses from this area, all of whom would have been members of this parish:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3457" rel="attachment wp-att-3457"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3457" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00617.jpg" alt="DSC00617" width="354" height="500" /></a>

There are eleven names on that monument; eleven young men from a village of maybe 200 people. The soldiers on every one of these monuments get a sharp military salute from me.

[caption id="attachment_3460" align="aligncenter" width="375"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3460" rel="attachment wp-att-3460"><img class="wp-image-3460" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00673.jpg" alt="DSC00673" width="375" height="500" /></a> Almost every town has a church, and in these small places, the cemetery is almost always around the church. For some reason, we like walking through them.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3462" rel="attachment wp-att-3462"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3462" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00679.jpg" alt="DSC00679" width="375" height="500" /></a>

Some more countryside pictures...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3461" rel="attachment wp-att-3461"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3461" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00675.jpg" alt="DSC00675" width="864" height="196" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3464" rel="attachment wp-att-3464"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3464" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00684.jpg" alt="DSC00684" width="864" height="648" /></a>

We love these long, very slow drives through the French countryside. It certainly gives us a different view than the cities, a view we like very much.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To wrap up our first ramble, we went to the town of Cahors. There's nothing particularly enticing about Cahors, but it is a good place to see some local sights. Yet, Cahors itself has some charms, among them, wine made from the malbec grape and renowned for its darkness. That's true; the wine we had was almost black, and while not up to Bordeaux or Burgundy standards, darn good. There's a surprise: good wine in France...

Anyway, here are some sights from Cahors. I'll post about a couple of day-trips we made from here over the next couple days.

That's Cahors. Not a place high on our list for another visit, but we enjoyed our stay here very much. Next up: two day trips, one to the beautiful cloister in Moissac and another an amble along the Tarn River to the west of Cahors.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We found a suggested route to the small towns on the Tarn River west of Cahors, so off we went.

See, nothing very special on this amble around the countryside. But we had a very nice day and ended it with a late lunch at this beautiful restaurant. It was located in a tiny village, and was one of the best lunches we've ever had. It was also one of the most expensive lunches, but what the heck: we're in France where Sunday lunches are actually dinners, and we sat outdoors and had a fine time.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Life can be complicated here, even in simple things. When I say that to people who have lived here a long time, I sometimes get some pushback: "No, it's not that bad. Not so complicated. Used to be worse," etc. Right. Here's complicated.

Tonight Mary and Gilles are having a dinner gathering for us, another couple and, of course, them. Laurie asked if we could bring a dessert and Mary said, "<em>Bien sûr</em>!" So this morning we went to get a cake at the bakery. There is a <em>boulangerie</em>/<em>patisserie</em> that we know has excellent cakes near the cheese shop in Bois-le-Roi, and as we needed some cheese we decided to go there.

Whoops. Closed: d<em>e vacances</em> for three weeks. Okay, there's another bakery in town so we'll go there.

Whoops. Closed: this particular bakery is closed every Wednesday. Well, there's a good bakery in our current hometown, Samois-sur-Seine, that we know is open on Wednesdays, so we'll go back there.

Whoops. Closed: sign in the window says, "Closed this Wednesday morning <em>uniquement." </em>Closed just this particular Wednesday, just for us. Okay, now we know there's a bakery in Samoreau, a ten-minute drive away.We do not know if it's closed for vacation or closed on all Wednesdays or closed this Wednesday <em>uniquement.</em> Off we go.

It's open! Yahooo! And parking right across the street! Whoo-hoo! And...they have no cakes. Really. They do, fortunately, have a selection of beautiful tartes, of which we buy six and call it a day.

Complicated. Let's go buy a cake. Four bakeries later we have dessert, but no cake. Complicated.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, when we stayed in Cahors, we took a day and drove to the small town of Moissac. Moissac is a nice town with one beautiful "must-see:" the cloisters of an old monastery. I'm finally getting around to posting some pictures and writings about our day in Moissac.

I don't know exactly why we're drawn to cloisters, but we are, indeed. There is something beautiful and peaceful and historic and spiritual about them. When we read that Moissac has what are said to be the most beautiful Romanesque cloisters anywhere, and saw that it was about an hour south of Cahors, off we went. We were not disappointed; here are the cloisters of Moissac.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3583" rel="attachment wp-att-3583"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3583" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00735.jpg" alt="DSC00735" width="864" height="486" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3582" rel="attachment wp-att-3582"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3582" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00725.jpg" alt="DSC00725" width="864" height="486" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3581" rel="attachment wp-att-3581"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3581" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00723.jpg" alt="DSC00723" width="864" height="486" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3580" rel="attachment wp-att-3580"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3580" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00722.jpg" alt="DSC00722" width="768" height="576" /></a>

The capitols of the seventy-six columns alone are worth the trip. Each is unique and each is exquisitely carved. Half are Biblical scenes, half are abstract designs.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3579" rel="attachment wp-att-3579"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3579" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00720.jpg" alt="DSC00720" width="864" height="486" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3586" rel="attachment wp-att-3586"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3586" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00724.jpg" alt="DSC00724" width="864" height="486" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3587" rel="attachment wp-att-3587"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3587" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00728.jpg" alt="DSC00728" width="640" height="489" /></a>

We spent hours in the cloisters. Rooms off them offered exhibitions about the monastery and monastic life, including a large display on the illuminated manuscripts done by monks here over the years.

Cloisters served several purposes. They were simply means of getting from one part of the monastery to another; glorious hallways, so to speak. And they were used by the monks for "walking prayers." Monks spent at least eight hours a day praying, and they could do some of that as they walked around the cloisters. I think that would have been my preferred route: I don't know how I could tire of this beautiful place.

And, of course, in the middle of serious cloister-appreciation, we had to stop for lunch, across the <em>place</em> from the cathedral to which the monastery and cloisters are attached.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3585" rel="attachment wp-att-3585"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3585" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00785.jpg" alt="DSC00785" width="864" height="486" /></a>

Then it was back into the cloisters for one last long sit...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3584" rel="attachment wp-att-3584"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3584" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC00744.jpg" alt="DSC00744" width="864" height="526" /></a>

We've seen a <em>lot</em> of cloisters in our day - we always take time to visit one nearby - and the cloisters of Moissac rank right at the top of our list.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're back in our favorite city, La Rochelle. We love this place and find that we enjoy it more every time we're here (this is our fourth visit). This time the weather is working to dissuade us, but it won't work. In 2013 we came twice because our first visit, in late-June encountered cool and cloudy weather. Still we loved the place, not least because we got a room on the top floor of our hotel, overlooking the entrance to the La Rochelle harbor and we spent hours just watching the activity of boats in and out of the harbor. We came back in September, asked for the same room and encountered about the same weather, but our love of the city just increased. Last year we decided to come in late July, knowing that even though the city would be stuffed with French families on vacation, the weather would be better, and it was. So it was that we booked for mid-July again this year, again asking for "our"room. We arrived yesterday in 98 degree sunshine. Woke up this morning to rain, lightning, thunder and winds (our hotel is named <em>les Brises</em> and it lived up to its name today!). But what the heck, we still love it. Here's some pictures.
<h2>Le P'tit Bleu</h2>
La Rochelle is on the Atlantic coast, and the old city is ranged around an ancient harbor, so it stands to reason that La Rochelle would have some good seafood restaurants. In fact, it has hundreds. One of our very favorites, though, may not qualify as a real restaurant. This is Le P'tit Bleu, which stands on the promenade along the old harbor.

Maybe not a real restaurant as such, but the best grilled calamari ever, and fabulous mussels (moules)." width="768" height="576" /></a> Le P'tit Bleu. Maybe not a real restaurant as such, but the best grilled calamari ever, and fabulous mussels (moules).[/caption]

Though I'm not a fan of food-photos, here's the <em>calamar grillé</em>.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3606" rel="attachment wp-att-3606"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3606" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04753.jpg" alt="DSC04753" width="864" height="569" /></a>

Here's the view to the west from the eating area of Le P'tit Bleu, looking out the mouth of the La Rochell harbor. The two towers were build in the 14th and 15th centuries:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3605" rel="attachment wp-att-3605"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3605" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04751.jpg" alt="DSC04751" width="785" height="576" /></a>

And to the east, looking at the restaurants ringing the old harbor.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3607" rel="attachment wp-att-3607"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3607" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04754.jpg" alt="DSC04754" width="768" height="576" /></a>

Another good thing about Le P'tit Bleu: you can have six or seven glasses of wine with dinner, because they give you glasses that are more like slightly large thimbles.Here's Laurie ready for her first glass:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3604" rel="attachment wp-att-3604"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3604" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04750.jpg" alt="DSC04750" width="362" height="480" /></a>
<h2>The Harbor</h2>
We were worried last year about visiting here in July, as that is when French families come here - in droves - on vacation, and we usually aren't too excited about being in a place full of tourists. But we found that it was great fun to be part of the tourist crowd, part of the families enjoying it here. Look at this picture taken along the waterfront: there are young couples, old couples, in-between couples, families, singles, everything, just enjoying a beautiful evening. I might also point out that this picture was taken at about 8:30 o'clock at night. Sunset here is about 9:50, which makes for beautiful evenings.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3609" rel="attachment wp-att-3609"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3609" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04757.jpg" alt="DSC04757" width="768" height="576" /></a>

We went on a long, interesting walk today; I think I'll save that for another post.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More on La Rochelle...

When we arrived Tuesday afternoon, it was 98 here: a little hot, even for heat-loving me. The next morning changed: rain, lightning and thunder! C'mon, could we find a happy medium?

We went for a walk along the water, toward the west (the city is about a mile to the east of us, an easy walk along a beautifully done promenade). We'd never walked in this direction and found it beautiful and interesting with some history and a surprise ending thrown in.

First we came on a small marina. I think the boat owners in this marina have to plan  their outings with a tide table in hand.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3613" rel="attachment wp-att-3613"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3613" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04769.jpg" alt="DSC04769" width="768" height="576" /></a>

We walked farther and found a route through a preserved area along a bluff above the water. We came upon this:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3614" rel="attachment wp-att-3614"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3614" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04777.jpg" alt="DSC04777" width="768" height="576" /></a>

Looks old, and indeed it is. A sign nearby said it was built during the Siege of La Rochelle, to watch for English ships trying to supply the city. That was in 1624!

We continued walking along the path...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3621" rel="attachment wp-att-3621"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3621" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04792.jpg" alt="DSC04792" width="768" height="576" /></a>

We met a few people, but it was pretty quiet, and beautiful, along the route. We came upon this, another structure build in 1624 for the Siege of La Rochelle.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3616" rel="attachment wp-att-3616"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04781.jpg" alt="DSC04781" width="768" height="576" /></a>

On either side of this structure were more modern remnants of war: bunkers built by the Germans during World War II, also to watch the approaches to the city.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3617" rel="attachment wp-att-3617"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3617" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04782.jpg" alt="DSC04782" width="768" height="576" /></a>

And the surprise ending: after walking a couple miles along the coast and seeing few people, we discovered a parking lot, returned to the trail and saw this:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3618" rel="attachment wp-att-3618"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3618" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04783.jpg" alt="DSC04783" width="768" height="576" /></a>

Chez Mamie! Mussels and fries (a French national dish, it seems) with a glass of wine for $11.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3619" rel="attachment wp-att-3619"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3619" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04785.jpg" alt="DSC04785" width="768" height="576" /></a>

We didn't eat here, but the place made us laugh.  Only in France can you walk along a quiet waterfront path, find buildings built in the 1600s, and then come upon an outdoor café, jammed with people. We loved it!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[La Rochelle has a little boat that goes between the old harbor and a big new marina called Les Minimes. It's about a twenty minute ride each way and gives a beautiful look at the harbor from a different perspective, that of being on the water. On our previous trips here we kept saying we were going to do this little boat trip, but never seemed to make it; we were determined to do it this time. Here's the boat:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3666" rel="attachment wp-att-3666"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3666" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04894.jpg" alt="DSC04894" width="640" height="480" /></a>

Now, the sign at the boarding place of this boat ride says, clearly, that it runs every half hour from 8:30 in the morning until 11:30 at night. Great, so we arrived at the departure pier at 12:15 one day. No activity. Finally an employee came up the ramp and we learned that the next trip will leave at 1:30 - lunch time, we guess. There is <em>no</em> mention of this break in the schedule anywhere on the schedule sign.

Okay, so we went off and did something else and decided to return that evening. We walked back into town at about 6:30 that night and arrived at a place where we saw lots of boats sitting in the water, and this above us:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3664" rel="attachment wp-att-3664"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3664" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04842.jpg" alt="DSC04842" width="338" height="450" /></a>

That is a diver standing on a platform that, we later learn, is 90 ft above the water. A couple seconds later:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3665" rel="attachment wp-att-3665"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3665" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC04843.jpg" alt="DSC04843" width="338" height="450" /></a>

As we stood there marvelling that any fool would do such a thing, it struck me that they were diving right into the passage that our little boat takes, which means...the boat will not  be running. Sure enough, no boat. (Turns out the event was the opening competition of the Red Bull Cliff Diving Championship; these guys do this in six or eight places around the world. Crazy!).

Fortunately, after dinner we got our boat ride, when the competition finished. And it was worth every bit of the wait: beautiful views of La Rochelle from the water. Total cost: 10 Euros. A funny story: as we sat on the boat for the first trip two women sat next to us and asked if we were two. "Yes," we replied, and she said, "Oh, good. There are four of us now and we can go as a family and save a Euro each." Sure enough, there's a family fare of 2€ each if the "family" has four people (individual fare is 3€), and they are not at all rigorous about what constitutes a family. We had an excellent conversation with these two French ladies, and saved 2€. What a deal!

A few unexpected turns, but well worth the effort.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We visited Chateau Les Milandes, the home of Joséphine Baker for many years, and loved the place for many reasons. But I don't know how to talk about Joséphine Baker, because she seems to be largely unknown in the country of her birth, the United States. Here are a couple pictures of her from the mid-1920s in Paris.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3689" rel="attachment wp-att-3689"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3689" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/baker.png" alt="baker" width="372" height="494" /></a>

[caption id="attachment_3688" align="aligncenter" width="364"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3688" rel="attachment wp-att-3688"><img class="size-full wp-image-3688" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/160519-josephine-baker-01.jpg" alt="Josephine Baker, (1906-1975) African American dancer, actress and entertainer, famous for her Paris stage shows and her scanty costumes (Photo by Bob Thomas/Popperfoto/Getty Images)" width="364" height="559" /></a> Josephine Baker, (1906-1975) African American dancer, actress and entertainer, famous for her Paris stage shows and her scanty costumes (Photo by Bob Thomas/Popperfoto/Getty Images)[/caption]

Here's a few things about her:
<ul>
 	<li>She was born in St. Louis, in 1906. To escape a childhood of grinding poverty, she started to dance in places around St. Louis, and in about 1923 went to New York to join the show "Shuffle Along." She was hired as a costume handler, but soon was asked to join the chorus line and was an immediate hit.</li>
 	<li>In 1925 she went to Paris to join a show called the "Revué Negré." She took Paris by storm, and was soon the headliner in the show with her dancing.</li>
 	<li>Over the next two decades she was the highest-paid performer in Europe. She was married several times, gaining French citizenship through one of the marriages.</li>
 	<li>She was a constant battler against racism and prejudice. In 1935, at the height of her fame in Europe, she returned to do a show in New York and was shocked at her treatment: though she had a room at a top New York hotel, she was told to use the servants' entrance, was refused service at the Stork Club, and had people spit on her.</li>
 	<li>She bought a chateau - Les Milandes - in the Dordogne and with her husband Jo Bouillion adopted 12 children of mixed racial backgrounds and raised them there.</li>
 	<li>During World War II she was a member of the French Resistance and given the <em>Croix de Guerre</em> by Charles de Gaulle for her efforts. Many Allied airmen were hidden in Les Milandes on their way to the border and freedom.</li>
 	<li>After the war she "re-invented" herself as a singer. Though not equipped with a great voice, her style and charisma made her a hit with many songs.</li>
 	<li>In 1969 she was broke (she may have been a great performer, but she was a terrible business person) and was evicted from Les Milandes. Her long-time friend Grace Kelly (then Princess Grace of Monaco) helped her find a place to live in Monaco. She returned to the stage as a singer and became popular all over again.</li>
 	<li>Her battle for civil rights and against racism brought her back to the United States several times. In 1963 she gave the speech just before Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream" speech in the March on Washington</li>
</ul>
Josephine Baker seems largely unknown in the United States, though her memory is still revered here in France. In 2001 a wealthy family bought her chateau at Les Milandes and has restored it as a memorial to her. The chateau and its gardens are beautiful, but Josephine is the star: the rooms of the chateau display memorabilia of her, including many of the dresses in which she performed - including the famous "Banana Dress."

We came here because I'd heard about Les Milandes years ago - before it was bought and restored to her memory - and having read about her, decided I wanted to see her home for so many years. It was totally enjoyable. Unfortunately, there was a sign forbidding picture-taking inside the chateau; fortunately the sign was in French and I couldn't understand it.

Josephine Baker fascinates us, and this visit to her home brought her to life for us. We urge you to read a bit about her, to learn about her courageous and often difficult life. She died in 1975 at the age of 69, the day after opening a new show in New York and receiving rave reviews from the hard-to-please New York critics. She is buried in Monaco.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We went to Sarlat, in the Dordogne region, after La Rochelle. Now, first off, the drive was...er..."interesting." Because we wanted to stay off the autoroutes (highways) and drive on backroads, I put "Limoges" into the GPS, as going through Limoges would take us through some scenic areas. Unfortunately, I did <em>not</em> notice that the GPS has accepted "Limoges-Fourches" which is way the heck away from Limoges. I quickly realized the GPS was giving me incorrect directions, then realized that the GPS showed a distance of 500 km when I knew it should be about 200 km. So I got off the highway and figured that out, but to get back on the road in the right direction, GPS took me through a supermarket parking lot (which, in fact, was the best way to go), where a large truck was blocking the road until I decided to go around it and <em>then</em> it decided to move, so I was driving alongside it, on the wrong side of the road. Anyway, we got out of the parking lot and onto the right road.

Later we needed gas and because we were on back roads, there were not a lot of gas stations. Finally got to the town of Cognac where surely there would be gas stations, and lots to drink if there weren't. First station: credit cards only and, despite the advertising that U.S. credit cards have chips, they don't work in automatic gas pumps. So, off we go. Next station: closed. Finally found a supermarket station with a cashier, so - phew - we got gas.

On to Limoges... The GPS took us accurately through this good-sized city, right to the autoroute entrance we were to take, which was closed for construction. Oh-oh; GPSs do not know what to do in a situation like this. I started to back-track through Limoges, as I was sure I'd seen a sign pointing to another way to the autoroute. The GPS is now, of course, complaining that I need to go back to that closed entrance. I did, indeed, find that other route, took it to the autoroute and away we went. A disaster averted, as far as I'm concerned.

Scenic roads have one drawback: they have lots of traffic, much of it big trucks. Slow. Finally we got off onto some real back roads, saw some beautiful little towns and made our way to Sarlat.

Our hotel at Sarlat was nice, with an excellent restaurant. We asked the most gracious woman at the desk if she could put a bottle of our champagne in their refrigerator for us to drink the next night. When Laurie went to get it the next day, that lovely woman had it in a silver ice bucket, with two champagne glasses for us. We sat in their peaceful garden and had our champagne.

The food was superb, too.[/caption]
<h2>Sarlat</h2>
Sarlat has a long history, but had fallen into bad shape until the 1960s. Then the Minister of Culture, André Malraux, found ways to get funds to French cities and towns to restore them and Sarlat was the first to get that funding. As a result, many buildings in the medieval core of the town have been restored. (Malraux himself is probably worth a post: a well-known novelist and philosopher, as Minister of Culture he pushed hard on getting France back on the world cultural stage. Among other things, he discovered an old, almost unknown law that required Paris buildings to have their facades cleaned once every ten years, and he enforced it. Paris went from being a dark and dirty city to having the beautiful buildings it has today.)

Sarlat's restoration has had a down side: tourists by the thousands, all in a small area. Sarlat is the second-most visited small town in France, behind Mont Saint Michel. And like Mont Saint Michel, there just isn't a large area for all those folks and so it gets crowded. But as in so many places, we found that if we walked a hundred yards from the tourist area, we found beautiful deserted backstreets.

Some pictures of Sarlat. These first were taken on a Sunday morning before the heaving crowds arrived.

We can agree with the comments about how interesting Sarlat is, but we can add something no guidebook mentioned: give it about two hours, unless you're the type that likes to peruse shops of medieval souvenirs, walnut products (the area is famous for them), <em>foie gras</em>, postcards, wine, and other miscellanea...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're in Brittany, on the Presq'ile Quiberon to be exact, staying at friends Jamie and Hervé's beautiful house in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon. It's beautiful here and a very enjoyable place: lots of French vacationers, beautiful beaches on both sides of the peninsula, a pretty town on the water, great seafood. I'll post some pictures of the area in a day or two; this post is about a place we find simply amazing: Carnac.

Carnac is the site of the largest stone alignments in the world. Brittany has the largest collection of alignments, menhirs (upright stones), dolmens (stone burial sites), and megaliths (menhirs that form a monument of some sort, such as an alignment) in the world and Carnac is its crown jewel. Carnac simply fascinates us. Here's an overview of a small part of the Carnac alignments:

[caption id="attachment_3787" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<img class="wp-image-3787 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07895.jpg" alt="DSC07895" width="576" height="432" /> This shows <em>maybe</em> 15% of the alignments at Carnac.[/caption]

The alignments are fenced, to prevent damage to them from visitors. I'm glad for that, and wish that had happened years ago. There are 3,000 stones in five different sites, but archaeologists believe that when Carnac was completed, there were double that. Where did the missing 3,000 go? They can be found in houses built in the area, in a nearby lighthouse, and in stone walls. Until 1960, the alignments were used as a campground! The only way to get into the alignments now, rather than seeing them from the perimeter, is to go on a guided tour (which limits foot traffic to certain areas), so we did that again (we did it last year, too). Some pictures from the tour:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3781" rel="attachment wp-att-3781"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3781" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07876.jpg" alt="DSC07876" width="576" height="134" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3780" rel="attachment wp-att-3780">
</a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3779" rel="attachment wp-att-3779"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3779" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07872.jpg" alt="DSC07872" width="576" height="432" /></a>

[caption id="attachment_3783" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3783" rel="attachment wp-att-3783"><img class="wp-image-3783 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07882.jpg" alt="DSC07882" width="576" height="432" /></a> The good and bad of Carnac: ancient megaliths and modern traffic jams. Lots o' folks here.[/caption]

Our guide concludes the tour with this comment: "If you ask, 'Who did this?' we can tell you. If you ask, 'How did they do this?' we can tell you that. If you ask, "Why did they do this?' we cannot answer. No one knows why this was built." Archaeologists are certain the purpose was not religious, as there are no religious artifacts found on the sites. Several theories hold that the alignments have a connection with celestial events: the rising of the sun or moon on the solstices or equinoxes, but the rows don't align with anything like that, and, in fact, the rows in the different sites are aligned in slightly different directions. A society that can build something like this would have been able to do it more accurately. (In fact, there are hundreds of burial mounds, small alignments, and stone circles in Brittany, and none of them seem to accurately point to a celestial event.)

There are some other mysteries. The alignments were built between 4,000 BC and 2,500 BC, the Neolithic period. But archeologists have found no traces of Neolithic-period settlements around Carnac; the closest are several miles away. That means that the people who built Carnac came from some distance away (several miles would have been formidable 4,000 years ago). And whatever the reason for the construction of the alignments, it held the attention of these people for 1,500 years!

There is a "daddy" of them all: this menhir, larger than most of the stones in the biggest alignment, likely was raised centuries before the rest of them, as it is much more weathered. It appears that the rows of one of the biggest alignments were oriented to this menhir which did, in fact, have evidence of being a funeral stone.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3785" rel="attachment wp-att-3785"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3785" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07887.jpg" alt="DSC07887" width="359" height="500" /></a>

I think Carnac fascinates us because of its mystery. For some unknown - and likely unknowable - reason, a society spent 1,500 years quarrying, moving and erecting huge stones in what must have been to them a meaningful pattern. This started 2,000 years before the first small pyramid was built in Egypt.

As I said, we've been to Carnac before, but there is one small alignment we'd not seen, so we went there first this time, and fell in love with it. The <em>Alignements du Petit-Menec</em> is the easternmost alignment, and although likely once connected to the other larger alignments, now sits isolated in a forest about a half a mile away. It's not well marked; we drove past the entrance before we found it. But it is the only alignment you can walk into, and we found it entrancing. Some pictures (and remember that when it was constructed 4,000 years ago, this was not a forest; these would have been in the open):

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3778" rel="attachment wp-att-3778"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3778" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07867.jpg" alt="DSC07867" width="356" height="475" /></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3775" rel="attachment wp-att-3775"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3775" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07851.jpg" alt="DSC07851" width="576" height="432" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3776" rel="attachment wp-att-3776"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3776" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07863.jpg" alt="DSC07863" width="576" height="432" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3774" rel="attachment wp-att-3774"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3774" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07840.jpg" alt="DSC07840" width="375" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3773" rel="attachment wp-att-3773"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3773" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07838.jpg" alt="DSC07838" width="375" height="500" /></a>

We loved this place so much that we returned to have our pique-nique lunch here. Here's Laurie preparing a sandwich in the company of a couple megaliths, first erected 4,000 years ago.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3792" rel="attachment wp-att-3792"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3792" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07908.jpg" alt="DSC07908" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Laurie was also able to make sure this megalith didn't fall over while we were there.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3777" rel="attachment wp-att-3777"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3777" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07866.jpg" alt="DSC07866" width="375" height="500" /></a>

We thought we were pretty smart to have the fixings for a picnic with us. But, on the road at the entrance to these alignments we saw an example of a true French vacation pique-nique. The picnic table and bench came out of the truck, and look at what else is in the truck: full mattresses and enough camping stuff to outfit a Cabela store.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3789" rel="attachment wp-att-3789"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3789" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07904.jpg" alt="DSC07904" width="576" height="322" /></a>

We later walked to the biggest menhir in the Carnac complex: the Géant de Manio, 20 ft high. Laurie was able to hold this one up, too.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3782" rel="attachment wp-att-3782"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3782" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07880.jpg" alt="DSC07880" width="375" height="500" /></a>

One last look at the Carnac alignments and we headed back to the house.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3780" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC07875.jpg" alt="DSC07875" width="576" height="131" />Nothing left to say except, we love this place. This certainly won't be our last visit to Carnac; it has a strong pull on us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I pointed out in the Carnac post, we're in the small town of Saint-Pierre-Quiberon. This is on the southeastern edge of Brittany, on Presqu'île Quiberon. Now, "presqu'île' translates to "almost an island:" in English, a peninsula. So we have water on the east side, the protected Bay of Quiberon, and water on the west side, open to the Atlantic Ocean. The west side is called, appropriately, the Côte Sauvage - the Wild Coast. It reminds us strongly of the Washington and Oregon coasts: headlands and inlets, and crashing waves.

Some pictures of the Côte Sauvage:

He's on a very busy road; he cannot see the beach from where he is. I guess we all have different ideas of what's relaxing and enjoyable.[/caption]

On the bay side is the pretty town of Saint-Pierre-Quiberon.

It was pretty cool the day I took these pictures, and in the morning, so there are few people on the beach. On a warm sunny afternoon, it's pretty crowded. The water temperature on the bay side is comfortable for swimming (no surf crashing in, either); the Côte Sauvage has colder water and big waves. So far, we haven't braved either side other than getting our feet wet.

Three years ago Jamie and Hervé, who have been coming here for vacation for many years, invited us to share their rented house for a few days. Though we're not beach people, we realized why Jamie and Hervé love it here: it's just beautiful and relaxing and fun to be here. Last year Jamie and Hervé made it a little more permanent, buying a house here in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon. Now they can come here for vacations and long weekends. Very nice, we say; very nice. Laurie and I thank them for bringing us to this beautiful place, and for letting us stay in their beautiful house.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3830" rel="attachment wp-att-3830">

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once in a while we encounter a new place that we immediately fall in love with, that we know is going to be a favorite. Dinan is one of those places. We were here three nights, could have stayed longer and know that we'll be back.
<h2>Our Arrival</h2>
After a three hour drive from Saint-Pierre-Quiberon, we arrived in Dinan. Now, Dinan is an old city and our hotel was right in the middle of the <em>City Historique</em>, which means right in the middle of the old streets built for horses when horses were small, and it also means where the tourists are. But I had the hotel's address in our trusty GPS and having become reasonably blasé about driving into places like this, charged into the city. We arrived at where the GPS located the hotel to find a.) we were, indeed, in the middle of a warren of small, mostly pedestrian, streets; and b.) there was no hotel in sight. Away we drove. We located a parking place, did some research, let the GPS find a new route and tried it again. The GPS promptly took us to a street with a big "Do Not Enter" sign on it and some words below, but as there were cars behind us, I didn't take the time to figure out the words, so I turned away. We wandered around a bit and finally approached the hotel from the same street as we originally were on, but this time saw that the last short street was, indeed, the hotel's street. This time we looked around more and, lo and behold, the hotel was right where we had stopped, both this time and on our first run through town. Now, I might mention that the hotel has a small sign above the second floor, which was not visible while we were in the car, so I have some excuse, but the GPS was right and I ignored it. Later, I realized that the "Do Not Enter" sign said, in small letters below it, "Except bikes, motorcycles and local service." Well, as far as I was concerned, driving to the hotel was "local service" so I drove down that street every other time we returned to the hotel, often to the amazement and glaring looks of the pedestrians. Anyway, we arrived and checked in.

Now the fun started. Our room was large and comfortable, and its main attraction: this view out one of its three large windows:

We spent quite a bit of time sitting at the window, drinking wine or champagne and watching the activity. Another window looked out on another beautiful street.[/caption]

The above picture was taken late in the day, when the tourist horde had subsided. Here's a picture of the same street in mid-afternoon:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3864" rel="attachment wp-att-3864"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3864" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC08007.jpg" alt="DSC08007" width="332" height="475" /></a>

Even though Dinan had a lot of tourists, we enjoyed the activity. It wasn't like Venice last year, where there were places a person could not even move because of the crowds, and here all the tourists are French - like La Rochelle: families of three generations walking together, couples, singles, folks just having fun.

Dinan was, like many larger medieval towns, a fortress town originally. Dinan has preserved almost all of its walls and they are amazing.

And to say that Dinan is beautiful understates the charm. One morning I walked out early to take pictures in the morning light (the morning tourist-less light, I might add). Here is early-morning Dinan:

We love Dinan. The town and the area around it are beautiful. We took two day-trips, one to the Emerald Coast and one to St. Malo. More on them later. We are already looking forward to a return to Dinan.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[St. Malo sits right on the Atlantic coast, and has quite a history. Records indicate that St. Malo existed in the 1st century, and during the 1800s it became notorious as the home-base of pirates on the Atlantic. Disaster struck at the end of World War 2, as the city was almost completely destroyed by Allied bombing in August, 1944. Four years later (!), when funds became available to rebuild the city, it was decided to rebuild it not with modern buildings, but using the same stone materials as before to the architectural designs as before. In essence, the new St. Malo would be the old, beautiful St. Malo, but freshly built. The result is an exceedingly beautiful place.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3882" rel="attachment wp-att-3882"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3882" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00481.jpg" alt="DSC00481" width="576" height="432" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3870" rel="attachment wp-att-3870"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3870" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00448.jpg" alt="DSC00448" width="576" height="432" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3868" rel="attachment wp-att-3868"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3868" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00445.jpg" alt="DSC00445" width="576" height="432" /></a>

St. Malo's beauty brings a downside: the city is the most-visited place in Brittany. During July and August, it is, as an English friend of ours puts it, "heaving with people." We visited for a day in mid-August, the highest point of tourism everywhere in France, and it was ugly.

Oy!

Laurie has my permission to shoot me if I ever dress like this:

I can wear whatever I want."[/caption]

But St. Malo has some beautiful sights, away from the crowds.

[caption id="attachment_3879" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3879" rel="attachment wp-att-3879"><img class="wp-image-3879 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00472.jpg" alt="DSC00472" width="576" height="432" /></a> Creperies everywhere! St. Malo is the main city of Brittany, the origin of crepes. I can tell you that if I were looking for crepes in St. Malo, this would be the place: away from the crowds, in a lovely street.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3878" rel="attachment wp-att-3878"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3878" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00469.jpg" alt="DSC00469" width="356" height="475" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3877" rel="attachment wp-att-3877"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3877" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00468.jpg" alt="DSC00468" width="576" height="414" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3881" rel="attachment wp-att-3881"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3881" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00479.jpg" alt="DSC00479" width="356" height="475" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3869" rel="attachment wp-att-3869"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3869" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00446.jpg" alt="DSC00446" width="576" height="432" /></a>

What to say about St. Malo? I'd like to see it off-season, that's for sure. I think it's interesting that the city is comprised of what are essentially "new-old" buildings, and these buildings hold their own against modern architecture. They are beautiful, in a different way than a <em>le Corbusie</em>r or a Frank Gehry building, but beautiful nevertheless.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We went into Paris for a couple days last week. After watching the weather for a few days we realized we had a choice: Paris cool and with a chance of rain, or Paris hot. The forecast was right: this week in Paris (and here in Bois-le-Rois) has been hot, hot, hot - in the mid-90s. Now Paris in the rain isn't great, but Paris in the mid-90s is undoable for us. So off we went Friday.

As a follow-up to my "La France est Compliquée" posts, here's another example. We have Navigo passes which can be recharged for a week ($23) and which provide unlimited use of the trains (which we ride to and from Paris), metros, buses (which we much prefer) and trams for that week. On Friday we arrived at the train station and I asked to recharge our Navigo passes for this week. Nope, can't do it. After Thursday, I can only recharge them for next week, which means that we can't use them for our trip, which starts on Friday. Now, if someone has a good explanation as to why we can't recharge a weekly pass after Thursday, I'd love to hear it. Anyway, we bought train tickets and when we arrived in Paris, metro tickets (also good on buses and trams). Compliquée...
<h2>Cité de la Architecture et Patrimoine.</h2>
This is likely our favorite museum in Paris. We returned - the fifth time we've been there - and still didn't see all we wanted to see. One floor of the museum is dedicated to models of buildings, with explanations showing the history of French architecture (in French, of course; between Laurie and I we can muddle through and understand. Mostly). Here is part of this floor:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3929" rel="attachment wp-att-3929"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3929" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05197.jpg" alt="DSC05197" width="576" height="432" /></a>

The museum has a fair amount about <em>le Corbusier</em>, about whom I've posted (<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=3227">le Corbusier</a>). Here there is a unit from an apartment building in Marseille that he designed. We spent probably half an hour in it, and Laurie's favorite thing was:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3928" rel="attachment wp-att-3928"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3928" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05187.jpg" alt="DSC05187" width="576" height="432" /></a>

The view is not bad from this museum...

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3930" rel="attachment wp-att-3930"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3930" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05199.jpg" alt="DSC05199" width="360" height="500" /></a>

This museum is worth a visit, for sure. In fact, we decided that when we return to France, we'll just buy a couple annual passes to it. I've posted about <em>Cité</em> in past years; if I can find the posts I'll add a link here.
<h2>Canal St. Martin</h2>
This is probably our favorite walk in Paris, rain or shine (and it ended with rain this time). Canal St. Martin was build by Emperor Napoleon to bring water to Paris, to ease transportation by boats of goods into the city and, maybe most importantly, to put a physical barrier between Paris and the Saint Antoine quarter, a powerful working class area from which revolutions arose. In the 1960s, as the need for the canal declined, there was talk of filling it and doing something with this most valuable land. Wiser heads prevailed, and the canal has remained, a beautiful path through the city.

<h2>Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine</h2>
For years I've gotten a big kick out of <em>Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine</em>. This is a big, crazy, busy, noisy, working street, and it fascinates me; I love to walk it. A couple trips ago I learned that there are many courtyards and passages off <em>Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine</em>, so I went looking for them, and I found a bunch. On this, our last trip to Paris this year, Laurie wanted to see these, and so off we went. I'll just post pictures of them with captions where appropriate.

First, a couple pictures of <em>Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine</em>. Actually, it seems a little calm here, on a Saturday morning, but you can see that it's a busy street.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3937" rel="attachment wp-att-3937"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3937" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05132.jpg" alt="DSC05132" width="576" height="432" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3945" rel="attachment wp-att-3945"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3945" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05146.jpg" alt="DSC05146" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Now for a look at the <em>passages</em> and courtyards that are connected to <em>Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine</em>. None of these are visible from the street; you have to just walk down the street and when you see a big double door, see if it's open. I have no qualms about going into the ones with closed doors. In fact, several of these were behind a closed <em>locked</em> door, in which case we stood outside until someone with the passcode to the door came in or left, and then we entered before the door could close. No one ever said a word to us about why were were there.

We love seeing these vestiges of an older Paris.[/caption]

Here there's a big sign blocking entry, so we asked the concierge if we could go in and look around. <em>Pas de problème. </em>She was as nice as could be.[/caption]

This is a place that restores and repairs chairs. We looked in the windows, and it was amazing.[/caption]

One last detour, to <em>Passage l'Homme</em>, around the corner from <em>Rue du Fauborg-Saint-Antoine</em>. This is also a beautiful place, pretty much unknown.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3955" rel="attachment wp-att-3955"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3955" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05172.jpg" alt="DSC05172" width="432" height="576" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3956" rel="attachment wp-att-3956"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3956" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05177.jpg" alt="DSC05177" width="432" height="576" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3957" rel="attachment wp-att-3957"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3957" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC05180.jpg" alt="DSC05180" width="432" height="576" /></a>

It rained off and on during this walk, and finally it started to rain enough that we called it quits. I know that few tourists will ever have the time or inclination to search out the <em>Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine</em> <em>passages,</em> especially after seeing the <em>rue</em> itself, with its noise and traffic and craziness. So I hope this post gives you a sense of a different Paris, the seldom-seen-by-tourists Paris. I still think this is one of the coolest streets in Paris.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Believe it or not, this is likely my last France post for this year. We're now in New York (grandkid pictures to follow), having left France last Saturday. Flight over was no problem, except a little late, shuttle was waiting for us, so here we are in Elmsford.
<h2>Chartres</h2>
For years - literally - we have been saying that we needed to go to the town of Chartres to see its famous cathedral. Last Thursday, we had one last free day and when Mary suggested a day-trip somewhere, I suggested Chartres, and off we went.
<h2>Casa Picassiette</h2>
Mary said we definitely should see Casa Picassiette before we went to the Cathedral, so we did. Casa Picassiette is, um, an "unusual" house. The man who lived in it covered darn near every surface with mosaic designs made from broken plates he picked up during the day. Only a few pictures will describe this; words fail me.

[caption id="attachment_3986" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3986" rel="attachment wp-att-3986"><img class="size-full wp-image-3986" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05300.jpg" alt="Casa Picasiette - one building of four and five. " width="576" height="432" /></a> Casa Picasiette - one building of four and five.[/caption]

But it gets better: some interior photos:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3987" rel="attachment wp-att-3987"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3987" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05304.jpg" alt="DSC05304" width="576" height="432" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3992" rel="attachment wp-att-3992"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3992" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05326.jpg" alt="DSC05326" width="375" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3988" rel="attachment wp-att-3988"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3988" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05310.jpg" alt="DSC05310" width="576" height="432" /></a>

The man who built this was truly an artist.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3991" rel="attachment wp-att-3991"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3991" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05317.jpg" alt="DSC05317" width="375" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3990" rel="attachment wp-att-3990"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3990" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05316.jpg" alt="DSC05316" width="576" height="432" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3989" rel="attachment wp-att-3989"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3989" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05315.jpg" alt="DSC05315" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Remember: <em>everything</em> was made from bits and pieces of broken plates over a period of more than 35 years. The man who created it worked at different jobs during the day and at his creation during the night. I might add, just as a sidelight, that he had several stays in a mental hospital. Just saying...
<h2>Chartres Cathedral</h2>
Most people who know these things say that the Cathedral at Chartres is the most beautiful Gothic cathedral in France and maybe the world. One reason is that it is far more original than other cathedrals; while there have been modifications, Chartres Cathedral is largely as it was when completed in the 13th century. Also, the cathedral was completed fairly quickly, meaning that its design is consistent throughout, with few hodge-podge additions tacked on at later dates.

In 2009 a major restoration started. Now, a key question in any restoration of this sort is, "To what period do you restore?" This restoration is being done to what was known of the Cathedral in in 1300s, when it was largely complete and fairly new. There are, of course, arguments among architectural historians about the restoration, but generally it seems to have been well-received. One interesting aspect is that, as the restorers cleaned walls, they discovered that in the 1300s the Cathedral interior was painted with a cream color, and so the restoration has used that color. It is just beautiful.

[caption id="attachment_4000" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4000" rel="attachment wp-att-4000"><img class="wp-image-4000" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/chartres-cathedral-interior-1024x768.jpg" alt="chartres-cathedral-interior" width="500" height="375" /></a> I cheated - this picture is swiped off the Internet. The lack of people gives away that I didn't take it, but honestly, the Cathedral was not at all packed with people, as we had expected.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3997" align="aligncenter" width="356"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3997" rel="attachment wp-att-3997"><img class="wp-image-3997" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05373.jpg" alt="DSC05373" width="356" height="475" /></a> A wall, showing the beautiful cream color to which the interior is being restored after cleaning and repair.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_3996" align="aligncenter" width="356"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3996" rel="attachment wp-att-3996"><img class="wp-image-3996" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05370.jpg" alt="DSC05370" width="356" height="475" /></a> The organ, for Margaret. We listened to it being played for a while. Honestly, though organs in these huge cathedrals are powerful, the acoustics are terrible, and they often sound muddy.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3995" rel="attachment wp-att-3995"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3995" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05340.jpg" alt="DSC05340" width="359" height="475" /></a>

The Cathedral definitely dominates the skyline in Chartres.

[caption id="attachment_3993" align="aligncenter" width="576"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3993" rel="attachment wp-att-3993"><img class="wp-image-3993 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05337.jpg" alt="DSC05337" width="576" height="431" /></a> The view from our table at lunch.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3998" rel="attachment wp-att-3998"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3998" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05378.jpg" alt="DSC05378" width="576" height="432" /></a>

Because the Cathedral sits on the highest point of the city, if you approach from the south, you can see the Cathedral towering on the horizon long before you see the city itself.

One last beautiful part of the Chartres Cathedral: because it has escaped damage and changes over the centuries, its stained glass windows are largely intact. The creators of these windows used a special technique to create blue from cobalt, and the result is that these windows are works of art, with spectacular blues in them.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=3994" rel="attachment wp-att-3994"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3994" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05339.jpg" alt="DSC05339" width="576" height="375" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4002" rel="attachment wp-att-4002"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4002" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC05362.jpg" alt="DSC05362" width="375" height="500" /></a>

The city of Chartres looks to be interesting, and deserves a couple days, we think. We will be back, and we are so glad that we used our last day-trip to see the Cathedral.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Yep, we’re in France again. In fact, we’ve been here almost two weeks, having arrived Wednesday, May 16. That means that, yes, I’m way behind posting to this world-famous - well, regionally well-known - travel blog. I’ll use the excuse that I’ve been busy traveling; yeah, that’s my story and I'm sticking to it.</p>
First, our itinerary for this summer:

May 8: we left Seattle for New York.
May 9 - 15: serious grandchild-squeezing with Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry in New York. Pictures to follow, of course.
May 15: off to France. An uneventful flight after sitting at JFK airport and watching a horrendous storm pass over the airport, so bad that the airport closed for about an hour.
May 20: Off on a ramble to the Southwest of France. Pictures to follow.
May 20 - August 21: Hang around France, eat some cheese, drink some wine, see some sights, Pictures to follow.
August 21: Off to Spain for three weeks. We'll drive from our home base in Bois-le-Roi/Samois-sur-Seine, visiting places we've been been to before: Zamora, Trujillo, Vejer-de-la-Frontera, Ùbeda and Segovia. Kind of a "greatest hits" tour, as these are our favorite small towns in Spain.
September 13: back to New York.
September 19: back to Seattle.

Should be fun...I hope you'll follow along with us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone who knows us knows these long trips are really just disguise for our very favorite activity: squeezing our grandkids! We went to Elmsford, NY first to refresh our grandkid-squeezing skills. We had just the best time with Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry. So, to get this 2018 version of our travel blog off to the right start, here are a few pictures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We made it to France - two weeks ago, actually - but not without a wee bit of drama at JFK in New York. We arrived at the airport plenty early (gotta love Lyft: cheaper, faster and way more comfortable than a shuttle), checked in, got through security (the TSA Pre-check line taking maybe twice as long as the regular line; go figure) and went to the gate. Our plane is there, everything looks good except that really dark, ugly cloud approaching the airport. Oh, did things get nasty. Rain and wind and lightning and thunder all around us; JFK actually closed for over an hour, and for a few minutes we could not see the runways about a quarter of a mile away because the rain was coming down so hard. We later learned that much of nearby Westchester County was without power for hours. We watched as the storm blew out to sea heading northeast.

Hmmm...northeast; that's the direction we would be flying. Gulp. We boarded our plane (our favorite, the huge, double-deck Airbus A380) and after taxiing for 30 minutes, took off. Smooth, calm, no problem for about ten minutes, then ten minutes of pretty rough air. Now, when an A380 is getting tossed around, you can only imagine what those little commuter planes experienced. But we finally reached smooth air and the rest of the flight was nice. I found it interesting that because we flew so far north, there was light on the horizon the entire flight; it never got completely dark.

We arrived, picked up our car (a Renault Clio for the fourth time but this time a premium version, with leather seats and other fancy gadgets) and headed to the house of our friends Mary and Gilles. They welcomed us with open arms (and cheese). I can't tell you how glad we were to be back in France!

After a few days at Mary &amp; Gilles' to recover from jet-lag we headed off on our first ramble, to the southwest of France: the Gers region, Toulouse, Albi and Clermont-Ferrand, Gilles' home town. I'll start a report on that trip tomorrow... stay tuned!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First stop on our first ramble: Brive-la-Galliard, in the Dordogne region. We stayed a night here to break up the long drive to the southwest, and we were glad we did stop. An old town, Brive is working to make itself attractive to folks, rather than just letting the town fade away. The first step seems to have been a common one: get cars out of the historic area. As a result, it's easy to stroll around the beautiful buildings of the downtown area, and so that's what we did.

[table id=2/]

I'm not sure we'd make a special trip to Brive, but it was a nice overnight stay. Brive represents lots of French towns, with beautiful buildings and excellent restaurants; a great place to just walk around and absorb Frenchness!
Next stop: the Gers region, specifically the area around Nérac.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After our brief stay in Brive-la-Galliard, it was on to our destination, the Gers region. This region is in southwest France and although we visited just a small part on its northern edge, we enjoyed it greatly.
The impetus for this trip was mostly a book: "Duck Season" by David McAninch. Now I'm not generally a fan of the "American moves to a small town in a foreign country and learns the meaning of life" genre of books, but this one was great. The Gers is famous for the quantity and quality of the ways it serves duck and Mr. McAninch writes about the ways that ducks pervade life in the Gers: hunting ducks, raising ducks, cooking ducks, eating ducks, stuffing ducks to get <em>foie gras</em>, etc., etc. It all sounded interesting, so off we went with Mary &amp; Gilles, our ever-patient friends.
Our base here was just outside the town of Nérac. From there we visited local towns but, oddly enough, had no duck - that had to wait until we visited Toulouse. But this area is beautiful, with lots of interesting things to see, and we're glad we visited.

<h3 class="entry_title">Moulin de Bapaumes</h3>
Our home in this beautiful area was a B &amp; B named "Moulin de Bapaumes." Now, I have not always been a fan of B&amp;Bs, but we hit the jackpot with Moulin de Bapaumes; it sets the standard for what a B&amp;B should be. Run by Danny and René, it has beautiful rooms and a beautiful setting. These two gentlemen know everything about the area and so offered recommendations on places to go, things to see, restaurants to try, and every recommendation was spot on. Honestly, I can't praise them enough, but I can say that this previously B&amp;B-phobe will be back to Moulin de Bapaumes in the years to come.

[table id=3/]

Now for some pictures of our rambles around Nérac...
<h3 class="entry_title">Villenueve-Mezin</h3>
This town is tiny, with maybe ten houses. But it has one cool place to see, and one rather interesting house. The cool place to see:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4202" rel="attachment wp-att-4202"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4202" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06478.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" /></a>
It's a fortress, right? Built to defend the town and surrounding area, right? Yes and no. It was originally built to defend the area, but soon after its construction, the main interior area was turned into a church. This probably occurred about ten centuries ago. For many years it fell into disuse and disarry, but a German architect, Herman Schmitz, became interested in restoring this rare fortified church and spent many summers here leading the effort. Now, the interior looks like this:

[caption id="attachment_4201" align="aligncenter" width="405"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4201" rel="attachment wp-att-4201"><img class="size-full wp-image-4201" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06475.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="720" /></a> One of two chapels in the church.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_4200" align="aligncenter" width="405"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4200" rel="attachment wp-att-4200"><img class="size-full wp-image-4200" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06474.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="720" /></a> The second chapel.[/caption]

The architect must love Villenueve-Mezin, as he also spent summers building a home here, on the remains of a small chateau. From the street, here is the home of him and his family:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4204" rel="attachment wp-att-4204"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4204" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06481.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" /></a>
Not exactly a restoration! The building does retain original walls and some original windows, but it has been modernized completely. Honestly, it's beautiful, and in this village, would be a place of complete calm and quiet. Here's a view of the countryside from Villenue-Mezin.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4203" rel="attachment wp-att-4203"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4203" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06480.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" /></a>
That's a lot to write about such a small village, but this village has some special places; we're glad we could make the trip to see it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following up on the Gers - Part 1 post, here are some other places we visited in the Gers:

<strong>Lavardac</strong>
This small town a few miles from our base at Moulin de Bapaumes has one distinguishing feature: an amazing country market. It has everything: from live animals to mattresses (and even a car for sale). We've seen lots of markets and always find them interesting; this was a great one.

</table>
I call the car above dangerous because a driver does not need a license to drive it. There's a whole class of cars here like that. They are limited to about 40 mph and are not to be driven on the autoroute (supposedly: I've seen one there, driving at 40 mph where the speed limit is 75.) Even around town, they're a nuisance. The dangerous part is this: blind? You legally could drive one of these, since you don't need a license. So the drivers of these cars are almost always folks who, for some reason, could not get a real driver's license. That may hint at their driving abilities. I give these things a wide berth and my full attention when I see one on the road.

<strong>Barbaste</strong>

Barbaste is another small town, with just one sight to visit, but quite an interesting site. Here's a picture of a small structure in Barbaste:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4330" rel="attachment wp-att-4330"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4330" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06575-1.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="720" /></a>

I know you're all yawning and saying, "Oh, yeah, another fortress. Boring!" In fact, it is kind of a fort - in this case, a fortified mill. In the 1300s, when this mill was built, only the king or his representatives could mill wheat and so the power associated with that (local farmers were dependent on that mill) was closely guarded. Hence, the mill was fortified and stocked with soldiers to maintain that power. This mill was abandoned for hundreds of years, survived and is now being slowly restored.
Next to that mill are two kind of interesting sights. The first is a bridge built a hundred years so so before the mill, so, about a thousand years ago. It's still in use.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4329" rel="attachment wp-att-4329"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4329" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06574-1.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="720" /></a>

And one last kind of funny thing. Across a street bordering the mill is a beautiful structure. Closer examination (and a hint from Danny and René at Moulin de Bapaumes) reveals it to be a "folie'; same as in English: a folly. This beautiful structure, which you'd expect to see as the façade on an impressive building, covers up...a staircase. Nothing else.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In previous years I've posted a couple times about <em>bastide</em> towns and, since we visited a few this trip, I'll combine them into one post. A little background on these interesting towns:

In 1337 the king of France died without a direct heir to assume the throne. Shortly after, the English and the French started arguing about who should be the next king of France. Because the English monarchy actually descended from a French royal family, the English, who still controlled large parts of southwestern France, thought their claim to the French throne was better than anyone in the French royal family. The French politely disagreed and the two sides fell to fighting. For the next 116 years they fought, in three periods of war with not much happening in between, until the French gained the upper hand and threw the English out of France finally.

During much of the Hundred Years War (which should really be the Hundred-Sixteen Years War), the main fighting was done in the part of France we traveled through on this trip). During the wars, both sides built these <em>bastide</em> towns - more by the English - which had several characteristics:
<ul>
 	<li>They were usually square, with straight roads in both directions to allow quick movement of troops from one side to another during a battle.</li>
 	<li>They were fortified with walls and towers.</li>
 	<li>They almost always had a main square, which contained a covered area for markets, and was surrounded by arcaded buildings.</li>
</ul>
With that background, here are a few <em>bastide</em> towns we visited.

<strong>Domme
</strong>An unusual aspect of Domme is that it is built on a hill and is definitely not square; most <em>bastide</em> towns were on flatter land. Because it is in the Dordogne region - a hugely popular tourist area - Domme has become a tourist attraction.

[caption id="attachment_4372" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4372" rel="attachment wp-att-4372"><img class="size-full wp-image-4372" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06394.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="181" /></a> The Dordogne Valley from Domme. Can you imagine being in an attacking army below and looking up at Domme while your officers said, "Go get it!"[/caption]

Domme was the site of some kind of "American Super-Car" gathering, as we saw 10 or 12 new Corvettes and these three Chrysler Vipers. I might point out that these Vipers, with their V10 engines, would require about somewhere around 60 cents of gas for every mile driven! I guess if you can afford a $70,000 car you can afford to drop five dollars just to get to the grocery store.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4357" rel="attachment wp-att-4357"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4357" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06390.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="197" /></a>

Like many popular tourist places, Domme has the tourist contrast:

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Domme is not our favorite <em>bastide</em>, because it seems that its primary purpose is to extract money from tourists' wallets.

<strong>Fources</strong>
Fources is an unusual <em>bastide</em> in that it is round. As with many towns of interest, it relies on tourist trade, as there is not much else to keep the town alive. Fources, though, is away from any strong tourist areas, so it has retained more of its small-town, historic feel. We liked Fources, and had a nice lunch here.

<strong>Lectoure
</strong>Ok, not a bastide, but Lectoure's church has the best church sign we've ever seen:

[caption id="attachment_4374" align="aligncenter" width="261"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4374" rel="attachment wp-att-4374"><img class="size-full wp-image-4374" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06669.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="350" /></a> "It is highly likely that a person entering this church will sense the call of God. In return, it is much less probable that he will contact you on your phone. " And a "turn it off" icon. Love it![/caption]

&nbsp;

<strong>Cordes-sur-Ciel</strong>

Like Domme, Cordes is built on top of a hill, and like the other <em>bastide</em> towns, it relies on tourism for income, although there is quite a lot of farming in the area and I suspect some people in Cordes support that farming. However, Cordes' main attraction for us was a startling church. The church has a beautiful and surprising interior; we just don't see interiors like this, especially in small, rural towns.

One last comment about Cordes: the town has been known as Cordes for centuries. But in its search for the tourist trade, Cordes took advantage of its position high on a mountain-top to rename itself to a more appealing name, Cordes-sur-Ciel: Cordes in the Sky. Ah, marketing...

<strong>Vianne</strong>
One last <em>bastide</em>, Vianne. This is a real live active town, not relying at all on tourism. I stood in the middle of the main intersection and took pictures looking down each of the four main streets that meet there.

The four fortified towers that are the entrances to Vianne - typical of the <em>bastides</em>.

Vianne had one other sight that brought us here: a bridge designed and build by Gustave Eiffel, he of Eiffel Tower fame. It's likely that his company designed and built it in the 1860s or 1870s, but official histories don't mention this bridge by name. Still, a beautiful little bridge.

Okay, that's enough for <em>bastides</em>. You're probably as tired of reading about them as I am writing about them. I've left out our favorite <em>bastide</em>, Monpazier. We stopped there for lunch and a slow stroll through town. If you want to read about our favorite, click here: <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=3416">Monpazier, 2016</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We spent three days in Toulouse with Mary and Gilles. Toulouse is a big city, home to Airbus (a tour guide asked us where we all were from and when Laurie and I said, "Seattle," her immediate response was, "Oh...Boeing"). Lots of interesting things to see, a river to walk by, a canal in the middle of town, and many beautiful buildings. Toulouse is known as the "Rose City" for it's buildings of reddish-pink brick. We enjoyed Toulouse. I'm not going to write a lot about it; just show some pictures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After three days in Toulouse, we hit the road again. We spent a night in Albi, which has two really amazing sights: a museum and a cathedral. I know you're saying, "Another cathedral!?!" Yep, and one different than any we've ever seen.

<strong>Musée Toulouse-Lautrec</strong>
This museum is worth a visit if for no other reason than to see the building. Toulouse-Lautrec, despite his name, was born in Albi in 1864. Once he'd made his way to Paris, he found his niche painting scenes from Paris night-life. From this background came the first posters advertising performers; Toulouse-Lautrec created this <em>genre</em>; his posters are still among the best, and certainly are the best from the <em>belle-epoque</em> of Paris. To honor him and his works, Albi created this museum, in the house of the Bishop of Albi.

A little background that explains why the Bishop's palace...I mean, house, was a fortress: up to the 1200s, this whole area was Protestant. In 1209, Pope Innocent decreed that it would no longer be Protestant and sent an army to conquer it. In 1229, the Protestants were defeated, with help from the French king. Defeated or not, they remained Protestant, and they hated the Bishop. So he built this fortress-palace to protect himself from the Protestants. As you'll see, the Cathedral of Albi also reflects the fortress mentality that the Catholic church had to adopt here.

Anyway, the Museé Toulouse-Lautrec:

<strong>La Cathedral Sainte-Cécile d'Albi</strong>
Following my story above, you'll understand the appearance of this Cathedral. It's a fortress, designed to show the power of the Catholic church to all the local folks who were still Protestants in secret. Another difference between this cathedral and so many others we've seen is that this is built in the local brick, and is of the "southern Gothic" architecture; that means <em>thick</em> walls.

But it's the interior that knocks your socks off! There is not one square inch of wall that is undecorated.

That was the extent of our visit to Albi. We saw the two necessary sights, but guidebooks relate that the town of Albi is also a beautiful and historic and interesting place to visit. Our schedule prevented that, but I suspect we'll be back sometime in the future to explore Albi more.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After Albi, we turned toward home (Bois-le-Roi home, that is), making two stops on the way. The first was near the town of Puy-en-Velay, and the second at Clermont-Ferrand.

<strong>Viaduc de Milliau</strong>

Both regular readers of this blog will know that we like bridges, so you'll know that we really liked seeing this spectacular one:

[caption id="attachment_4583" align="aligncenter" width="650"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4583" rel="attachment wp-att-4583"><img class="size-full wp-image-4583" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06851.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="366" /></a> The Viaduc de Milliau.[/caption]

This bridge is 2,650 meters (1.64 miles) long and rises almost 800 feet above the valley floor. It is an amazing engineering feat and beautiful to boot!

<strong>Puy-en-Velay</strong>

Puy-en-Velay is a nice town with two churches worth visiting, one of which we decided probably wasn't worth the effort...

[caption id="attachment_4584" align="aligncenter" width="366"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4584" rel="attachment wp-att-4584"><img class="size-full wp-image-4584" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06873.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></a> A fascinating church, but after giving serious thought to visiting it, we decided to take a pass. Well, not <em>that</em> serious, actually; there are something like five thousand steps to it. Okay, 286 steps, but that was 285 too many for us.[/caption]

<strong>Clermont-Ferrand</strong>

We've wanted to visit Clermont-Ferrand for a long time because a.) it's a place we haven't been; b.) it's well-known for its cuisine and cheeses; and c.) it's where our friend (and most-excellent driver on this trip) was raised. Mary and Gilles had some business to complete here, so we spent a night. It's a good-sized city (about 140,000 people) and has an unusual style of architecture, due to the stone used to build many of the buildings in the downtown area. The quarries in the area produce a building stone that is almost black. Using this stone resulted in a different look.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4590" rel="attachment wp-att-4590"><img class="size-full wp-image-4590" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC06924.jpg" alt="" height="500" /></a>

This cathedral has some beautiful stained glass windows.

A sidelight: here are two pictures from churches in Clermont-Ferrand and Puy-en-Velay. These are "Black Madonnas," small wooden Madonnas carved from dark wood and aged over centuries to almost pure black. They are actually found all over the world, but seem to be more prevalent on churches that were stops on the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. There is some evidence that they all came from one workshop in Eastern Europe, but that evidence is sketchy. No one really knows where they came from nor why so many ended up on the pilgrimage. We've seen probably a dozen of them over the years and are, I admit, fascinating.

With that, I'll close up my posts on our first ramble (two weeks after we returned!) We had a great time, saw lots of new, interesting and beautiful things, and ate like monarchy. I have no doubt we will return to this area in southern France again; we barely scratched the surface of things we want to do and see here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had the great pleasure to introduce an old friend to Paris a couple weeks ago. When Laurie and I were in Coronado, across the bay from San Diego (in my Navy days), we became closest of friends with Paul and Sue, who lived in the same apartments. We have stayed in touch with them ever since, though we moved to the Northwest and they stayed in the San Diego area. Before we left, we got an email from Paul, who was starting a tour in Paris and wondered if, should he arrive a couple days early, we could get together. <em>Mais bien sûr! </em> We think it's been 12 years since we've seen them, so we were really looking forward to seeing him (Sue decided to stay home...the tour Paul was going on was a military history route; more on that in a bit).

Paul arrived June 1st and we toured him into the ground for two days. By the time we parted ways, all three of us were dragging! But still happy:

[caption id="attachment_4623" align="aligncenter" width="488"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4623" rel="attachment wp-att-4623"><img class="size-full wp-image-4623" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_1881.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="650" /></a> Paul and Laurie - worn out but still smiling - in front of a bistro where we had an excellent dinner in the small, beautiful square Place du Marché Saint-Catherine. A wonderful way to end a great visit with a long-time friend.[/caption]

Paul's tour sounds great for a fan of military history. In WW II, the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army was the first to go into combat at D-Day: they were parachuted behind German lines the night before the invasion. Despite huge obstacles, they accomplished their immediate mission and then went on to fight through the Ardennes Forest, Belgium, Luxembourg and into Germany. The tour Paul was on followed the path of the 101st Airborne - the Screaming Eagles - through the war, ending at Hitler's lair in Austria. I'm an inveterate non-tour guy, but I would love to have been with Paul on this trip through WW2 history.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we have no rambles planned for the next two weeks, we'll be doing lots of walks and day-trips from our home-base here in Bois-le-Roi. I'm working on a post for just Bois-le-Roi so you can see where we are spending June (I'll do another for Samois-sur-Seine, to which we move next week). For now, though, a quick post about a walk.

Our route yesterday took us along the river in a neighboring town, La Rochette. There we saw a number of <em>affolantes, </em>houses that were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when this area - particularly on the Seine - became a preferred location for wealthy Parisians who could afford weekend/summer homes here. I've written about the <em>affolantes</em> before<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=3208">;</a> here are pictures of some we saw yesterday.

		<title><![CDATA[A Walk in Saint Mammès]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Saint-Mammès is one of our favorite places to visit for a walk, so today off we went. As always we enjoyed our stroll, and the morning ended with a surprise - a good one, at that.

Saint-Mammès is at the confluence of the Loing River and the Seine. Just a half mile away the Canal du Loing joins the Loing River. The Canal du Loing is the main canal to mid-France, and from it a boat can reach the Mediterranean (via the Rhone River) or the Atlantic (via the Garrone River through Bordeaux). Once the Canal du Loing was busy with commercial péniches (barges) but today we see only pleasure boats and tour boats on it. However the location of Saint Mammès means that it became the home port for many pèniches, and remains that for the increasing number of <em>huge</em> barges we see on the Seine. As a result, Saint Mammès has many old, no-longer-in-operation pèniches and quite a few of the big new ones lining the quais. In fact, the school-age children of the pèniches go to school here, so there are always lots of boats.

We always walk along the Quai du Loing, which, amazingly enough, runs along the Loing River. There are lots of boats now used as houseboats along here, and also some activity in companies that repair boats of all types. And there are beautiful houses along the quai:

These houses have wonderful views onto the Loing River and are on quiet streets. They have one drawback: two of the last three years the Loing has flooded and the bottom floors of these houses were under water. That might make me think about living in one...

Some péniches, old and new, in Saint-Mammès:

Another thing we love about Saint-Mammès is that our favorite Impressionist painter, Alfred Sisley, lived in a neighboring town - Moret-sur-Loing - and painted many pictures of Saint-Mammès. Like Moret-sur-Loing, Saint-Mammès has a number of places where Sisley painted and the city has erected a display showing the picture. Today, you can look at the Sisley picture on the display, then look up and see the exact scene. Not much has changed in the 130 years. I wrote about this a couple years ago: <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=258">Some stuff about Saint-Mammès from 2013</a>

And the surprise: as we walked Saint-Mammès, we noticed a small restaurant that was not there two years ago. We walked past it, greeted the woman cleaning it in preparation for lunch and looked at the menu for lunch: two courses (entreé and plat - first and second courses - or plat and dessert - second and third courses: 12€, about $14). After building an appetite with our walk, we decided to give it a try. It was excellent: the food was way above-average for a small-town, small restaurant, the woman serving was friendly (and pretended to understand my French; always a bonus), the <em>carafe d'eau</em> (the pitcher of tap water one can always get in a restaurant) was ice-cold - a rarity - and the whole meal, including two beers and two coffees, was about $40. A find!

That's Saint-Mammès, one of our favorite day walks. This won't be the last time we're here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On our first long stay here (2013), we did a ramble to Bourges and some places around there, and we asked Mary and Gilles if we could go to Sancerre. Although we were not great white wine fans, we'd heard of the white wines of Sancerre. We went, we tried, we were hooked; the white wines of Sancerre are dry and flinty - they have a hint of minerality to them that we love. Fortunately, we can drive to Sancerre in about an hour and three-quarters, so Tuesday the four of us headed south, added a side trip to Guédelon, bought a little wine at a Sancerre winery, and stopped for a bit on the way back to see a favorite bridge.
<h2><strong>Guédelon</strong></h2>
Laurie and I saw a documentary about Guédelon a couple years ago and have wanted to visit since. Twenty years ago, someone thought it would be interesting and instructional to build a thirteenth-century chateaux, using thirteenth-century tools and techniques. Today Guédelon is maybe two-thirds complete, and has become quite the tourist attraction. Understandably so, as it's very interesting and well done. There are workshops in which tiles and shingles and windows and furniture and everything else are made, stone for the building is carved and rock quarried, all as it was done 800 years ago. There is a working thirteenth-century mill on site, built only with techniques and tools that were available then.

The day we visited, hundreds of school kids were also there (it's the end of the school year, a traditional time for school outings). We enjoyed watching the kids in  the workshops, carving stone and doing other educational stuff.

All the Guédelon workers are willing to talk about their work, showing how it's done. There are something like 40 people working there, which explains why the chateaux rises slowly; in real life in the thirteenth century, there would have been hundreds of people working here.

[caption id="attachment_4727" align="aligncenter" width="338"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4727" rel="attachment wp-att-4727"><img class="size-full wp-image-4727" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC00584.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="600" /></a> The pieces of the arched window were cut and formed by hand on site.[/caption]

We saw somewhere that they expect to complete Guédelon in twelve more years. But...I've been on a lot of projects and I know what happens to project completion dates. A better estimate is "TBD."
<h2>Sancerre</h2>
Not much to say here: we bought a few bottles of great wine...

[caption id="attachment_4730" align="aligncenter" width="366"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4730" rel="attachment wp-att-4730"><img class="size-full wp-image-4730" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC00597.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></a> Madame prepares 24 bottles for us and a little less for Mary &amp; Gilles  (who already had some in their cellar)[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_4731" align="aligncenter" width="650"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4731" rel="attachment wp-att-4731"><img class="size-full wp-image-4731" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC00599.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="366" /></a> Gilles is going to need a trailer hitch on his car someday.[/caption]

The 24 bottles doesn't include the bottle Madame gave us as thanks for appreciating and buying their wine. Ever see anyone in Napa leave the winery with complimentary bottles? Nope.
<h2>Canal <em>and </em>Bridge</h2>
Y'all know that Laurie and I love visiting the canals of France, and that we also like bridges. So what could be better than a canal bridge? This canal carries the Canal Latéral à la Loire across the Loire River; a canal on a bridge. Pretty cool, we think.

[caption id="attachment_4733" align="aligncenter" width="338"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4733" rel="attachment wp-att-4733"><img class="size-full wp-image-4733" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC00602.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="600" /></a> The canal is a little over 2,000 ft long. While it appears to have nice sidewalks on each side, these were actually paths for the horses that pulled the barges.[/caption]

Then, it was homeward bound. A nice ramble on a beautiful day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A week ago, June 29, Laurie and I celebrated our 50th <em>anniversaire de mariage</em>. We were perfectly okay with that until I mentioned that we've been married half a century. That took away both our breaths!

Our French family gave a lovely party for us - fourteen people, on Jamie and Hervé's beautiful new terrace, lots of champagne and lovely wine, excellent food and, best of all, wonderful conversations with great folks. Couldn't have been better.

Fifty years! I say it's been easy for me, but I don't know how Laurie did it. Unfortunately, when I say that, she agrees! The fact is, it's been a great half-century, and we are looking forward to the next 50 years.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We made a long sojourn into Paris last week - five days and nights. That's the longest we've stayed there in years, and although it was the hottest stretch of the year - between 85 and 92! - we had a terrific time. We saw a jazz singer we love - twice, did some museum time, spent a wonderful day with friends, saw a parade, walked, just all kinds of good stuff. Here's a recap:
<h2>Hetty Kate</h2>
In Seattle, we often attend house concerts of jazz singers (jazzvox.com, if you're interested, and if you like jazz vocalists you should be interested). Last year we heard Hetty Kate sing and just loved her. Talking to Hetty after her performance then, she said she was moving to Paris. We've kept in touch with her and when we arrived, she told us that she was singing in a small club in Paris Saturday June 30. With Mary and Gilles, off we went to see Hetty.

I will leave until below our arrival in Paris. Hetty was just wonderful and the experience - seeing great jazz in a small Paris jazz club, well, pretty cool. Some pictures from that night:

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Hetty told us that the following Tuesday she was singing in the bar at a (very nice) hotel, so off we went again - this time just Laurie and I. We met Hetty an hour before she started and shared a bottle of Sancerre wine with her, and heard her tales of performing and trying to get known in the Paris jazz scene. We stayed for her first set and were again blown away by how good she is. It was great fun to have a chance to get to know her better and hear her sing again.

Though Hetty is based in Paris now, she sings all over the world. If she gets to your city, you really need to go see her. You will not regret it; she is just fabulous!
<h2>The Parade</h2>
Arriving at our Metro (subway) stop to see Hetty, we were astonished to hear music - lots of <em><strong>REALLY LOUD</strong></em> music from multiple bands - while we were still underground in the Metro station. We climbed the stairs and ascended into the mayhem of the Paris Gay Pride Parade! And mayhem it was: many tens of thousands of people; music trucks everywhere, in the parade and not; and because it was over 90 degrees, people in <em>every</em> state of dress and undress. I'm telling you, you haven't seen anything until you've seen a 6'5" guy dressed as Roman woman, wearing 5" heels!

<h2>Friends</h2>
For the second time this year, we were able to introduce Paris to friends who had never been there. Mark and Kathy, friends from Seattle, were in Paris for one day at the end of a sixteen day trip to Italy (for a wedding), Austria and Switzerland. We met them in the morning and just kind of toured around the parts of Paris we like best - mostly along the Seine. We also went to the Eiffel Tower, which is a mess, as there is a huge amount of construction work underway. At the end of their trip, and after a particularly stressful travel day the previous day coming from Geneva, Mark and Kathy were just happy to go where we wanted to go...slowly.

After dinner, we walked our favorite walk in Paris, around Ile Saint Louis. The evening weather was perfect: warm and comfortable, and we enjoyed what was - weatherwise - the nicest evening in Paris we can remember, and we've had a lot of evenings here. I told Mark and Kathy, "It's an evening like this that will bring you back to Paris." Actually, that evening will bring us back to Paris!

<h2>Institute du Monde Arab</h2>
The Institute du Monde Arab is a center for study of the world loosely designated as the "Arab World:" the Middle East mostly, but also including parts of North Africa and the now-extinct Ottoman Empire. This area was the birthplace of the three major Western religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. The museum that's part of the Institute does a beautiful job of showing the birth, growth and connections of the three religions. We've visited it before and did again this trip, largely because of an exhibit on the construction and history of the Suez Canal, but also because we love the permanent exhibit of the art from this part of the world.

<h2>Corot at the Museé Marmottan</h2>
Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot (1796-1875)) is known largely for his beautiful landscapes - he's arguably the best and best-known landscape artist of the 19th century. During his career, though, he painted portraits of people he knew, though he exhibited only a few of them, and sold them only to friends for their private collection. The Marmottan presented the first exhibition dedicated to his portraits, and we like the Marmottan, so off we went. Corot probably could have made a living as a portraitist - his portraits are that good. This was an interesting look into an almost unknown side of this famous artist.

If you're a fan of Impressionist art, the Marmottan is a must-visit. The son of Claude Monet donated his entire collection to the museum, which created a large space just for them. It's pretty spectacular; though we've seen them three or four times before, we toured it again. Monet was nothing short of a genius, and that shows in this collection.
<h2>Promenade Plantée</h2>
From 1859 to 1969 a railroad ran on an elevated track from Bastille east to Vincennes. Abandoned in 1969, it sat unused until the late 1980s, when the city started to re-purpose it as a pedestrian walk. It was landscaped, water features added, stairs installed at intersections, and then the eastern end, where the path is not elevated (in fact, it runs through several tunnels) was made into a park. Not far from our Paris homebase, it's a perfect walk for us.

It seems that I've left out some things, but that covers the highlights. I could mention our train trip home where, among other things, the train broke down one station away from the one we needed to reach, but what the heck, this post is long enough. We were a little concerned at going into Paris on such a hot week, for that long (Paris is, no matter how beautiful, a big, noisy, crowded city and so can wear you out). But we had a great time, and are so glad we went. We're already looking forward to getting back.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week we went back to the Loire Valley, a two-and-a-half hour drive south of Samois-sur-Seine, our current homebase. The Loire is famous for its many chateaux - some estimates put the number at somewhere around 3,000, for the Loire Valley alone. We visited three quite different chateaux this week, and the three illustrate different types of chateaux, and the challenges that the privately owned chateaux face.

The first chateau we visited was Villesavin. Villesavin represents many chateaux and their challenges. Privately owned, without a glorious history of ownership or visits from kings and queens, it has little access to state funding to maintain and restore it. As a result, this beautiful renaissance chateau has to rely on the funds generated by visitors, with some small assistance from the state. But also because Villesavin hasn't the illustrious history, it is not high on the visit list of tourists. But visit it we did and we loved it.

The second chateau has all the advantages Villesavin lacks: Chateau Amboise was originally a fortress, then modified heavily by Francois I, was the home of Henri II, Charles VIII, Henry III and Henri IV. It is spectacularly sited where tourists can easily reach it. As a result, it gets lots of funding from France and lots of income from tourists. Note we loved Chateau Amboise, too.

The third chateau, Azay-le-Rideau, falls into a different category: though it hasn't a royal history, it is the most beautiful Renaissance chateau in the world (our humble opinion) and because it was given to France in 1905, it has been maintained and restored ever since, so its condition can only be described as near-perfect. Azay-le-Rideau is our favorite.
<h2>Villesavin</h2>
Villesavin was built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton who was, purely by coincidence, King François 1st's Secretary of Finance. Le Breton was also in charge of obtaining material for the king's over-the-top Chateau Chambord, which was nearby. Might one think that maybe some funding and some materials were diverted to Villesavin? Just wondering...

Built in the 16th century means built in Renaissance style. By this time, the king was firmly in charge and the aristocracy fairly stable, which meant there was no need for the chateau to have a defensive role.The pictures show the pure Renaissance style of Villesavin. A closer look shows that the chateau is just tired - there has not been the necessary funds over its 400-year life to maintain it. A large restoration project was carried out fifty years ago, but we can only guess how much it would cost to bring a place like this back to its original condition. Because Villesavin is still privately owned, there is just not enough money to restore it.

And yet, we loved it. Many chateaux have been restored to better condition than they were when people actually lived in them. At Villesavin I suspect we saw a more realistic view of life in a chateau.

<h2>Amboise</h2>
Chateau Amboise suffers from none of the disadvantages of Villesavin. It was built by kings - mostly François I in the 16th century; his successor kings and families lived here for centuries; it is smack on the Loire River so every tourist sees it; and it has seen many historic events. In fact, in the 15th and 16th centuries, this was the home of the French court. So France, seeing this as a national treasure, has maintained it and restored it. And like Villesavin, we loved it.

Chateau Amboise was originally a fortress, from which the king's army could control movement on the Loire River, but by the time François I and then Charles VIII added to it, they were in firm control of France and so the need for fortifications went away. As a result, these kings concentrated on creating Amboise as a symbol of their power, rather than a means to maintain that power.

Amboise also has the distinct honor of being the burial place of Leonardo DaVinci. Yes, <em>that</em> Leonardo! François I brought Leonardo to Amboise in 1516, three years before his death. Françoise gave Leonardo a manor (Clos Lucé, about which a bit more below) and when Leonardo died in 1519, he asked that he be buried in a church in Amboise, which was done. But later the chapel in which he was buried was destroyed, and Leonardo's tomb disappeared. In 1863, bones and an inscription that seemed to indicate they were the remains of Leonardo were found and he was re-interred in the chapel of Chateau Amboise, with a note that the remains are "presumed" to be his.

We were mightily impressed with Chateau Amboise: history, beauty, royalty, intrigue, gardens - Chateau Amboise has it all. This is a place we'll visit again.
<h3>Clos Lucé</h3>
Leonardo's home, given to him by Françoise I, is now a museum, with his bedroom, studio and other rooms fitted out as they might have been when he lived and worked here. Maybe...but we were not terribly impressed. First of all, it was jammed, and seemed to have an inordinately large number of 4-8 year-old kids, who were not suitably impressed by what they saw. And really, who can blame them? Were we interested in 16th century furniture when we were that old? No, so like these kids, we would have fidgeted and whined and asked when we could get a treat. Second problem was that large tour groups were allowed in, so we were stuck between groups of 35-40 people, in rooms so small the whole group could not get into the room. Fortunately, the gardens were lovely. But as the most expensive museum we've visited, we were highly disappointed. We left after about 90 minutes.

Looks beautiful, but not our favorite place. Not even on the list of favorite places.[/caption]
<h2>Azay-le-Rideau</h2>
This is our top-of-the-list favorite chateau and one of our favorite buildings in the world. Azay-le-Rideau followed a different path than the previous two chateaux. It doesn't have the long history of Amboise, and though it shares its Renaissance architecture with Villesavin, money has been (almost) no object in its maintenance and restoration - it was recently closed for two years for an extensive overhaul. The difference has been that in 1905, the owner of Azay gave the chateau to the French government, and the government, understanding that Azay is a perfect example of a Renaissance chateau, has maintained it since. This was our third visit here, and we will surely be here again, even if it means a special trip. We can sit in the beautiful gardens and spend a long time just looking at this beautiful gem. Because Azay was owned by just a few people over its hundreds of years (including the ubiquitous François I for a while), the rooms have been restored and furnished to illustrate life in the chateau from the 16th century to the 19th.

If you could visit only one chateau in the Loire Valley, I would recommend Azay. But Amboise has much more history associated with it and so I could recommend it, too. But I might point out that we've seen only half-a-dozen chateaux here. If there really are 3,000 chateaux here, we've got some work to do...
<h2>Le Grenadier</h2>
No, not another chateau. We stayed at a B &amp; B named Le Grenadier, our second stay here. It is a great B &amp; B: rooms are comfortable (Laurie says Madame Butterworth, our gracious host, has thought of everything a woman could want; I don't know what that means); excellent breakfasts; a beautiful yard to enjoy, and, most of all, a place to relax after a hard day of chateau viewing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A great benefit of staying here for a longer time is that we can do things that we wouldn't do if we were here for three or four weeks. Today is an example of that. In 2013 we stayed in the small town of Montigny-sur-Loing for five months; Montigny is about twenty-five minutes south of our current homebase in Samois-sur-Seine. While there, we walked miles along the Loing Canal, which connects the Seine with another canal 45 miles south. Today, we got to float down it!

The Loing Canal is built to what are called the Freycinet specifications. These specifications, developed when Charles Louis de Freycinet was Minister of the Interior, were instituted in 1879. They called for the locks of a canal to be 40 meters long and 5.2 meters wide; as a result, boats were built to this standard and, as canals were converted to it, could travel through any Freycinet canal.

The problem now is that the Freycinet canals are too small for profitable commercial transport. A Freycinet péniche (barge) can be 39 meters long; we regularly see transports on the Seine that are double that and have seen a few that are 110 meters long (360 ft). Now the Freycinet canals, including the Loing, are used almost exclusively for pleasure boats.

Last Saturday we learned that there is a 90-minute boat ride on the Loing Canal, leaving not far from Montigny-sur-Loing, so today, we put on our nautical clothes and went along.

[caption id="attachment_4951" align="aligncenter" width="540"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4951" rel="attachment wp-att-4951"><img class="size-full wp-image-4951" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05471.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a> Our boat for the morning: the Zia.[/caption]

Right off the dock: the Fromonville bridge. Originally it was a stone bridge (built around 1880) which was destroyed in 1940 in a futile attempt to slow the German army advance. The Eiffel Company designed and built this replacement post-war. Gotta say that I love iron bridges.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4936" rel="attachment wp-att-4936"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4936" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05450.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>
Can you see why we liked walking the canal in 2013? Calm, peaceful and beautiful. We walked probably 15 miles of this canal, a few miles at a time, repeating many sections.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4937" rel="attachment wp-att-4937"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4937" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05452.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>
A Freycinet lock. This is now unused, but you can see how narrow it is. Our boat was about 1.5 feet narrower than the lock. Going out, the captain skillfully guided the boat through the lock without touching either side. Coming back, he didn't do quite so well...
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4938" rel="attachment wp-att-4938"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4938" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05455.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>

When the Loing Canal was active, an important cargo was sand; but not just any sand. Sand from this area is said to be among the purest in the wold: 99.9% silica. It has been used by the Murano glassmakers (Venice) for hundreds of years, and now is in demand worldwide for telescope glass.

Some houses along the river as we approached Nemours. River life looks nice, doesn't it, except that in 2016 the water level along here rose about 15 ft from what you see, in the worst flood since 1910 and the third-worst in history. All these houses would have had water four or five feet deep on their main floors. Not so nice.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4945" rel="attachment wp-att-4945"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4945" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05459-1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>
The river bank in Nemours. We walked along this beautiful promenade in 2013, so it was fun to see it from the river.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4946" rel="attachment wp-att-4946"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4946" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05460.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>
Another iron bridge, this time a pedestrian bridge.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4947" rel="attachment wp-att-4947"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4947" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05461.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="313" /></a>
On the way back, the City Hall at Fromonville. Once the local chateau, it was given to the town of Fromonville-Moncourt, which has a population of about 2,000. I think all of them could fit in the City Hall.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4948" rel="attachment wp-att-4948"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4948" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05465.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="321" /></a>
Back at the dock, our "shipmates" depart. You might notice a high proportion of gray-haired folks. It appeared that a local retirement home had an outing, as everyone knew everyone else, except us, the only non-French-speakers on board. However, we were given an excellent English (well, kind of English) written guide to the trip. We took the morning trip and early in the afternoon, we drove by the dock after visiting a local town and saw that, under a big tent, was another group of folks "of a certain age" as the French say (includes us now), having lunch before boarding for the afternoon trip. Someone is doing a good job of marketing!
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4950" rel="attachment wp-att-4950"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4950" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05467.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>
I gotta say, this was a totally fun thing to do. The Loing Canal was a big part of our stay here in 2013, and to float up and down it for 90 minutes was a great pleasure.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2013, when we were planning for our first long-stay here, I read about towns around our 2013 homebase in Montigny-sur-Loing. The town of Moret-sur-Loing looked interesting, especially when I read that Alfred Sisley, long one of our favorite Impressionist painters, lived here, died here and is buried in the local cemetery. So we made an early trip to Moret, fell in love with it, have visited it <em>many</em> times since, and love it more every time we're there. This morning, we made yet another visit, so I want to post a lot of pictures of our visit. In a country of beautiful and interesting small towns, this is our favorite. This post will be mostly pictures; hope that's okay.

[caption id="attachment_4972" align="aligncenter" width="540"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4972" rel="attachment wp-att-4972"><img class="size-full wp-image-4972" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05396.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a> Does it get anymore beautiful? Any questions why Moret is our favorite place in this area and probably our favorite small town in the world?[/caption]

See the plaque under the left window?[/caption]

The plaque says that on the night of March 19, 1815, Napoleon slept here as he traveled to Paris after leaving his first exile on the island of Elba. Now, "Napoleon slept here" is similar to our "George Washington slept here" (if either of them actually slept in every place that claims that, they would both have lived to be 300 years old), but I think this one is fairly well documented.

<h2>Alfred Sisley</h2>
Alfred Sisly painted some 500 pictures in Moret-sur-Loing and the surrounding area. In Moret and the surrounding towns there are plaques showing a picture he painted from that place. Here's an example;

[caption id="attachment_4975" align="aligncenter" width="540"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4975" rel="attachment wp-att-4975"><img class="size-full wp-image-4975" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05409.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a> A plaque showing a painting by Alfred Sisley, one of the original (and, in our humble opinion, one of the best) Impressionists.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_4976" align="aligncenter" width="540"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=4976" rel="attachment wp-att-4976"><img class="size-full wp-image-4976" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05410.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a> The view today from where Sisley set up his easel.[/caption]

Pretty cool, eh?

Laurie and I have taken to visiting the graves of people we admire, so of course, we visited Sisley's grave. Nice to tell him in person that we love his paintings.

It amazes us to think that Sisley's paintings sold for the equivalent of a few hundred dollars in his time. Now? Sell your house for a small one.
<h2>L'Eglise Notre Dame</h2>
Moret's church fascinates us. It is gothic, built in the late-twelfth century. Where many churches of that time are gone, or have been added to and changed, or over-restored, L'Eglise de Notre Dame just <em>is</em>. Not much changed, except for a few modifications to keep it standing, it shows what churches of that time looked like. We find it lovely.

Some sights from the "back streets" of Moret:

The plaque below says "1638 Sucre d'Orge des Religeuses de Moret." It was in this building that nuns created the barley-sugar candy for which Moret is famous (sort of). They invented it in 1638!

That's Moret-sur-Loing. We will be back here, many times, I suspect. It's a lovely small town, not overrun with tourists, though more people should come to see it. This is France at its best.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We came into Paris yesterday for a couple reasons: 1.) an exhibit titled "Impressionists in London" at Petit Palais; 2.)  a planned return visit to Musée Nissim de Comando; and 3.) why wouldn't we go to Paris if we have the chance? Today we went to the exhibit, and though I took no pictures, here's a brief report:

It was great. Glad we went.

Laurie says I have to provide a little more detail. Ok, ok. Many of the Impressionists spent time in London, particularly around the 1870 - 1875 time frame, when Paris was a mess (Prussian invasion and the Paris Commune had roiled life in the region). This exhibition displayed paintings from the well-known Impressionists (Monet, Sisley, Pisarro) as well as many others who were part of that crowd:  Tissot, Daubigny, Dalou among them.

We loved the known Impressionists, of course,  and found a new favorite: James Tissot (born Jean-Jaques). Born in France, but evidently an almost-lifelong Anglophile, he moved to England after fighting in the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian war, and lived there until 1882 or 1883, when he returned to France following the death of his love Kathleen Newton. Before moving to England he studied painting in several French studios and learned the ways of Impressionism. While in England he painted scenes from English society and gained great renown (and income). We loved his paintings of this time; they reminded me of Auguste Renoir's later paintings - Luncheon of the Boating Party, Dance in the City, Dance in the Country, Dance at Bougival. He will definitely get some attention from us. Here are a couple of our favorite paintings in the exhibit:

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/James_Tissot_-_Too_Early.jpg/800px-James_Tissot_-_Too_Early.jpg" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/James_Tissot_-_Too_Early.jpg 1.5x" alt="File:James Tissot - Too Early.jpg" width="600" height="412" data-file-width="1059" data-file-height="728" />

<img class="mw-mmv-final-image jpg mw-mmv-dialog-is-open" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Ballonshipboard_jamestissot_1874.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" crossorigin="anonymous" />

I gotta say, we love this about Paris (and other <em>big</em> cities): there is always something cool going on, no matter what your interests are.

Tomorrow: Musée Nissim de Comando.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As promised, yesterday we went to the Musée Nissim de Comando, one of our favorites. First, a little background on this gem.

Möise de Comando, born in 1860 in Istanbul into a wealthy Jewish banking family, moved with the family bank to Paris in the early 1900s. He became a passonate collector of furniture and art of the late 1700s; he believed that era was the most refined in history. Given his wealth and passion, he was able to build the finest collection of art and furniture of the 1700s in the world. In 1911 he decided to tear down the mansion in which he lived near Parc Monceau (this area was then one of the priciest in Paris and and remains so), and build a 1700s style house so he could live in, use and display his collection. When he died in 1935, he willed the house and collection to Paris; it is named after his son, killed in World War I.

Laurie and I love to visit places that have rooms restored or maintained in period style (any period, really). Musée Nissim de Comando is the apex of this type of museum; built in the 1900s and maintained since, it is essentially a perfect representation of the house of a wealthy family from the late 1700s. This was our second visit and we appreciated it more this time. I think last time we were gobsmacked by the place; this time we were able to absorb it better.

Here's the house, from its courtyard. I could guess the house has about 12-15,000 sq ft, not including servants' quarters. The house had between 10 and 15 full-time servants at any given time.
<h2><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5100" rel="attachment wp-att-5100"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5100" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05701.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a></h2>
<h2>Rooms</h2>
Without further ado, some pictures of the rooms of this mansion.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5105" rel="attachment wp-att-5105"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5105" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05655.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="345" /></a>

The dining room:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5114" rel="attachment wp-att-5114"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5114" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05688.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5093" rel="attachment wp-att-5093"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5093" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05683.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>

The Sitting Room:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5102" rel="attachment wp-att-5102"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5102" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05634-1.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="540" /></a>My favorite room: Moïse's study/workroom. It even had a day-bed, for those days when a nap would be nice...(every day, in my opinion):

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5103" rel="attachment wp-att-5103"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5103" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05642-1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>

One view of the Library. The windows look out on a beautiful garden and, beyond the garden, Parc Monceau.

[caption id="attachment_5076" align="aligncenter" width="540"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5076" rel="attachment wp-att-5076"><img class="size-full wp-image-5076" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05638.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a> Comando had purchased these walls before the house was designed and wanted to use them in the library. Hence, the height and design of the floor was dictated by the walls he already owned.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5104" rel="attachment wp-att-5104"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5104" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05645.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>A room in which guests were received:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5106" rel="attachment wp-att-5106"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5106" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05656.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>

The main Living Room:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5107" rel="attachment wp-att-5107"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5107" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC05658.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="304" /></a>

The living room, above, has more furniture and <em>objects d'art</em> in it than when de Comando lived here, to show his collection better. Most of the other rooms are as when the family was here.

As if the rooms and the furniture weren't enough, here are some pictures of the details in the house which were, of course, perfect everywhere.

Now, it would be nice to say that Moïse de Comando lived happily every-after in this house of his dreams, but no. In his early 40s, he married a much younger woman and had two children. She then left him for an Italian count. Moïse was completely devoted to his two children and when his son was killed in World War I, he pretty much withdrew from the world. His brother, who had run the family bank, died, and Moïse, having no desire or need to run the bank, closed it down. He continued his collecting and particiated in several organizations devoted to collecting and books. He died in 1935, which may have been for the best, because in 1941 his daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren were deported to Auchwitz, where they died. Today, the de Comando family line no longer exists.

But this beautiful house stands as a monument to Moïse de Comando's passion (and his financial ability to indulge that passion). We think this is the best of the "small, specialized" museums in Paris, we will certainly visit it again, and we honor Moïse de Comando for what he collected and built.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had an...um..."interesting" day of travel yesterday. More than once we fell back on the "when something goes wrong" philosophy of our friends Marv and Becky who, when they encounter something crazy, say, "Someday we'll look back on this and laugh, so we might as well laugh about it now." Wise words...
<h2>Driving to La Rochelle</h2>
Off we went, only a few minutes later than planned. Now, we knew we would be traveling on toll roads and we knew what the tolls would be at each of the three toll booths. We also knew that our fancy-schmancy, chip-equipped Alaska Airlines Visa card would not work at the toll booths, so we had cash.  (I should point out that it is difficult for us newbies as we approach the toll-booth lanes to tell which lane takes cash, and there might be a lane with a person to take our non-automatic card, but you can't tell which lane, if any, that person is in until you're committed to another lane.) First toll booth, no problem. Second toll booth, I inadvertently entered a lane that took credit cards only. <em>Merde! </em>I knew this was going to be a problem. But I asked Laurie to give me our Boeing Employees Credit Union fancy-schmancy, chip-equipped Visa card and...it worked! This is a big deal to have a working card for the tolls and we were quite happy about it.

Half an hour later we went through the place where drivers pick up a ticket to start the next toll portion. No problem. An hour or so later, we left the autoroute so had to pay our toll. We roll up to the booth, confident because I've got a working card (and cash as a backup). I insert my toll ticket and the machine spits it out. <em>Merde</em>! Tried again. Same thing. Again, same thing: says it can't read my ticket. Now we had this happen to us a few years ago so I knew what to do: push the red Help! button and talk to the voice at the other end.

"Bonjour," says the voice. "Bonjour," says I (remember, <em>every</em> transaction in France starts with bonjour). "J'ai un problem. Est-ce vous parlez Anglais?" "Oui, a little." I explain that the machine rejects my card and she says, as I expected, "Read me the last five numbers printed on your ticket." (When you get the ticket as you come into the toll road, it prints on it a big long number that records where and when you entered, so they can tell how far you've driven, hence, what you have to pay.) I look at the ticket, and there are no numbers printed on. I tell her, "There are no numbers," and get the response, "What do you mean there are no numbers?" I explain and she asks, "Where did you get on the autoroute?" The booths are all named and she thought I would just happen to remember the name of the place where I'd gotten the faulty ticket. Right. Fortunately, after failing to remember that little bit of esoterica, I say, "It was south of Tours." "Oh, okay," and the machine flashes the correct toll (19.30€, about $22), and she says, "Now you can insert your card. Au revoir," and signs off. Phew.

Not so fast. At that moment, a window in the ticket-taking, toll-paying machine opens and a very nice employee asks if we're having a problem. I explain it to him, he looks at the ticket, points to a blank spot on it and says there should be numbers printed there. "No numbers," I say. "No, no numbers. It happens," he responds, takes the ticket, closes the door and disappears. I then insert my credit card to pay.

Not so fast. Evidently, as I talked to the now-gone employee, the machine has timed out, and now it will not let me even insert the card or a 20€ bill. If there hadn't been a solid gate down in front of the car, I would have just left without paying. I push the red Help! button again, get <em>another</em> person, and explain to him the problem. He, of course, says, "Read me the number on your ticket," to which I reply, with just a little exasperation in my voice, "I don't have the ticket because an employee took it and, anyway, if I had the ticket, there were no numbers on it." "What do you mean, no numbers?" "We got on the autoroute south of Tours, and the toll is 19.30€," said I. "Okay..." That amount appears on the machine, I put the card in, it works, the gate goes up and off we go.

It seemed like two hours, but in fact was probably ten minutes (to do something that should take ten seconds). The entire time we had a huge truck behind us and that must have been the most patient truck driver in the world, as not once did he honk or yell at us. I will say one thing, though, that shows we've become reasonably comfortable here: over the entire time, with one thing after another going wrong, we never panicked, thinking we'd be at the toll booth for days or that someone would come and arrest us for toll-road fraud; never got angry; never got frustrated. We just kept thinking, "We'll get through this somehow," and we did. Laugh we did not.

Always an adventure...
<h2>But wait, the day's adventures are not over...</h2>
In La Rochelle we stay at a lovely hotel with a beautiful view of the water. One room is on the corner of the top floor and has an almost 180 view of the harbor. We lucked into staying in this room the first time we came here and have asked for it every time since. We were so pleased to again be in this room. But...an adventure lurked.

We love La Rochelle, and after we arrived, we took a nap, had some wine, walked into town, had dinner at our favorite "colorful" restaurant (more on that in a later post) and walked back to the hotel.

At 10 o'clock we were sitting on the balcony outside our room, enjoying a beautiful sunset on a warm evening and a lovely glass of wine when the automatic shades that cover the door from the room to the balcony started to close. I didn't realize what was happening for a second and when I did realize, my old brain did some remarkable feats of thinking and I immediately realized that if those shades closed completely, we would be sitting on a balcony on the sixth floor <em>with no way to open the shades and get back into the room!</em> I jumped up and grabbed the shades and got it to stop about a foot above the ground. Then I crawled inside and tried to use the switch that raises and lowers the shades to get them back up. They went up about a foot and stopped.

So in this beautiful room, where we always leave the shades and windows up and open all night so we have fresh air and the sound of the waves, we have a shade with about two feet of opening.

I call the front desk, start to explain the situation and get the response, "I don't speak English." So I go down there, with Google Translate in hand. He comes up to the room, fiddles around and saying, "<em>Ne marche pas,</em>" leaves. Yes, that's right, it wasn't marching at all. <em>C'est en panne</em>: broken. So we prop the shades up as much as we could with a chair, open the door to the room to get some ventilation (the hotel might be a 3-star, but air-conditioning? <em>Pas de climatesée</em>). A night of miserable sleep followed.

This morning I went to the manager, who came up to the room and checked things over. She found that the master switch to power in the room was messed up a bit, and when she fixed it, the shades went up. So all we lost was one night of sleep. That's all. Nothing more. Grrrrrrr.

When I pointed out to her that we had no way of knowing that the shades were going to automatically close at 10 pm (I didn't even address <em>why </em>they would be set to do that), she said that when we checked in, the receptionist should have told us. "No, no one said anything to us about that." She responded, "That's not normal." No, I guessed that being stuck on the balcony was not normal. I suspect someone got a talking-to soon thereafter.

Today looks cooler than yesterday, good for a long walk. We might walk off some frustration while we're at at. Update: it just started to rain.

Update: there is actually a kind-of-logical explanation for what happened, which I will share with any fool who wants to hear it. The important bits are that someone should have explained to us that the shades are connected to the master switch (they didn't), that they will close at 10 pm if the room key isn't in the master switch (it wasn't) and that when the card is put into the master switch, the shades should be controllable by the shade switch (they weren't).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is our fifth stay in La Rochelle. One thing we realized almost immediately on our first stay is that La Rochelle is devoted to seafood. It's on the Atlantic, and has a long history of being a home for a large fleet of fishing boats, and a center of shellfish farmers, first and foremost being mussels, in French: <em>moules</em>. I was not a great fan of mussels before I arrived in La Rochelle; now, I'll have them just about every chance I get.

And we have found a favorite place for <em>moules. </em>This is fine dining at its best. Situated right on the water is <em>Le P'tit Bleu</em>, and we love this place. We ate dinner twice here this trip, and probably would have a third time, but we know a lovely small restaurant that we always go to for dinner the last night we're here.

[caption id="attachment_5183" align="aligncenter" width="720"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5183" rel="attachment wp-att-5183"><img class="size-full wp-image-5183" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC07323.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" /></a> <em>Moules</em>. They put a bunch in aluminum wrapper, with some amazing seasonings, and grill them. They arrive so hot we have to wait a few minutes to start the feast.[/caption]

The menu is limited - things that can be done up on a grill: <em>moules</em>, grilled sardines, grilled calamari (we share an order of this, with our <em>moules</em>, and it is also fabulous), oysters, etc. No <em>frites,</em> though, as they have no place to fry them. In fact, they won't allow a customer to bring <em>frites</em> from one of the nearby <em>frites</em> stands to the dining area, as they want to keep the gulls away and <em>frites</em> will draw them like seagulls to french fries.

As for value, each order of <em>moules,</em> and that's a lot of <em>moules,</em> is 6.95€ - about $8. A similar-sized portion, though with <em>frites, </em>at restaurants right across the street, is 14.50€. And you can't sit right on the water there. We get a nice bottle of Muscadet and a couple large rolls that we use to soak up the broth from the <em>moules; </em>that's a tasty fill-us-up meal for about $40. Love it!

Any wonder why we keep coming back to this crazy place? Honestly, we've been looking forward to <em>moules</em> at <em>Le P'tit Bleu</em> for two years!<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5184" rel="attachment wp-att-5184"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5184" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC07324.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the fifth time we've visited La Rochelle and it confirmed for us that this place is one of our favorite places in the world (except maybe that first night: ). La Rochelle is quite a historic city, with many buildings from the 1600s and 1700s still in place. (For more on La Rochelle, check this post from previous trips: <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=3602">2016 -1</a>, <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=3643">2016-2</a>, <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=2542">2015</a>, <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=769">2013</a>). For this post, I'm mostly just going to present some pictures.</p>

<p>Another of our favorite places is Dinan, in the northern part of Brittany. We came here two years ago and just loved it. Dinan is a medieval city, with walls and towers and many buildings looking just as they did 600-800 years ago, when they were built (the recorded history of one building goes back to 1224!). We returned this year and were not disappointed; in fact, we enjoyed this visit more. We did a couple new things, walked to a beautiful nearby town and, as before, just enjoyed being in this place.</p>
<h2>Around Dinan</h2>
<p>Dinan is a pretty interesting place to just stroll about. It has many buildings that have been here for hundreds of years.</p>

<h3>Our River Cruise</h3>
<p>We read of a boat that daily comes from St. Malo up the Rance River to Dinan and thought that would be a cool thing to do. Maybe so, but it was also complicated, requiring taking a train to St. Malo early enough to get the boat, and there are no direct trains; figuring out the schedule which changes depending on tides at St. Malo (which is on the Atlantic coast); and then finding out that there wasn't even a boat scheduled for two of the three days we were in Dinan. So we walked down to the port where the boat arrived to see if we could get some more information and found  a one-hour boat ride on the Rance from the port, four times a day. Sign us up! We had a great boat "cruise" on the Rance.</p>

<p>On the boat ride described in the Dinan post, I showed some pictures of Léhon, which we passed on the ride. The town, especially the abby there, intrigued us and so the next day, we took the 20-minute walk from our hotel to Léhon. We found the abby, walked around it and the town, then walked along the Rance river back to Dinan. </p>

<h3>Abbaye St. Magliore</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Abbaye of Saint Magliore was founded in the 12th century and survived until the French Revolution (1789). Since then it has gone through several lives and now survives as the church, where services are still held (occasionally) and a conference/exhibition center, using the other buildings that were part of the Abbaye. We found it to be a beautiful and peaceful place and were glad that we'd seen it the day before and made the effort to visit it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We came from Saint-Jean-de-Luz in France yesterday to Zamora, Spain. Now, I know I owe you posts on some day-trips we took last week, and one on Saint-Jean-de-Luz ("appalling" might sum it up), but our return to Spain has been pretty amazing, so I'm going to skip ahead. I will fit in those last two France posts Real Soon Now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We stayed in Zamora ten or twelve years ago and decided to make it our first stop on our "Greatest Hits of Spain" tour this year: towns we've visited and loved in the past. No big cities or new places this trip, just smaller, loved places. Honestly, we had not expected Zamora to be as great as we've found it already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our first experience: we went out for a walk after we arrived and as it was a little warm (about 88F) we soon got to a point where we were tired, thirsty and hungry: time for refreshment and a sit-down. We found a small bar which was, miraculously, air-conditioned, and ordered two beers and some tapas. Over the next 45 minutes or so, we had those beers (<em>muy frio)</em> and eight tapas - four each. When the bill came I was shocked: 9€, about $11. And the tapas had been substantial enough that we skipped a full dinner. Not a bad start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then we walked down to the castillo at the western end of the old town to see the sunset. While there we heard from inside the castillo the overture to the famous opera Carmen (set in Spain), then the sound of flamenco dancers warming up. As there was a line of people at the entrance to the castillio (at 9 o'clock at night) we wondered what was up. So we joined the line, entered and found that we were part of the audience for a flamenco performance by a famous mother-daughter team of bailoras (women flamenco dancers) and their students. It was fabulous. Laurie and I know enough about flamenco to know good from mediocre, and this was far better than good<em>.</em> The daughter was great, and the mother absolutely hypnotizing. When she finished her dance, the audience went nuts. She is evidently quite famous in Spain (she's from Seville, a center of flamenco), as we mentioned her to someone we met the next day and he was was amazed that we'd seen her. The cost for this performance, performed in a courtyard of a thousand-year-old castle, under beautiful warm skies, was extravagant: 0 Euros. Converted to dollars, that's $0. Pretty amazing, we think.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our hotel here is one of Paradores chain, in a converted convent from the 1700s. It's nice. Very nice. As in, 4-star nice. After where we stayed in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, it's a freaking palace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"regular"} -->
<p class="has-regular-font-size">So, we love Zamora! More tomorrow on the eleven Romanesque churches within ten minutes of our hotel, the walls, the plazas, the...whatever we find!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We were in Zamora for three days and think it might be our favorite place in Spain. The old city of Zamora (<em>casco antiguo</em>), in which our hotel was located, is the most fascinating place. Within easy walking distance of our hotel were a dozen Romanesque churches, all built in the 11th - 14th centuries. There was a fortress, a beautiful river walk, lovely streets, lively plazas with many restaurants and tapas bars. Other than that, the place was totally boring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, some general thoughts and pictures about Zamora.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For centuries Spanish towns and cities have held onto the tradition of the <em>paseo</em> - the evening walk. Though it is disappearing in places, especially the cities, many places hold onto it, and Zamora falls into this category. Here's a picture, taken at about 8:30 in the evening, of the main street through the old part of the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figcaption>The paseo in Zamora.</figcaption>
</figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Duero River runs through Zamora and, of course, has an old bridge across it. This one has an inexplicable name: "The Stone Bridge." Ok, maybe not inexplicable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Romanesque Churches</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zamora has so many churches of the Romanesque architectural style that the city is called The Romanesque City. Before showing some pictures, a little background on Romanesque:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Romanesque architecture started to appear in the 700s throughout Europe. Architects of the time had not solved a key problem that later architects did solve, resulting in the soaring Gothic cathedrals: how to support the weight of high walls and roofs required in the larger churches they were building. Their solution was to build thick walls, and thick walls meant no ability to add stained glass windows or lift the building height. Also, the only arch available to them was a rounded one, which is not as strong as the pointed arch that later allowed Gothic buildings to rise to great heights. So Romanesque architecture is marked by thick walls, rounded arches and small windows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if Gothic buildings, which started to appear in France in the 12th century, are soaring and graceful, Romanesque buildings have their own beauty. They are simple and solid and powerful. I think there's no place better than Zamora to get your fill of Romanesque.</p>

<p>Each of these churches has a person just kind of watching over them and answering questions. We visited one church where the fellow told us that it was the oldest church in Zamora. At the next one, the woman there told us her church was the oldest church in Zamora. I looked them up: turns out either could be, as the dates of their construction are not known. Both, however, are referenced in city records in the mid-1100s, so maybe they both deserve the title "oldest."</p>
<p>This is just a taste of the Romanesque churches in Zamora. There are twelve of them within 10 minutes of our hotel. We visited probably seven or eight; the others were not open when we arrived. Next trip...</p>

<h2>Modernist Buildings</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the late 1800s/early 1900s, an architectural style that came to be known as Modernism arose in the northeast part of Spain, centered in Barcelona. Modernism revolted against the established and accepted architecture of the time by basing its designs on nature: buildings became curvy, with plant and animal motifs everywhere. In Barcelona this style was best represented by Antoni Gaudi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For some reason, Zamora became the Spanish center of Modernism, but definitely a Modernism that incorporated features from other styles. One of the main features seen here and in Barcelona is the oriel window, a bay window that does not extend to the ground floor (there's a picture below of an oriel window). There are many buildings here with oriel windows, and many with the organic designs of Modernism. Throw in some influences of Art Deco, with its straight lines and geometric designs, and you have a most interesting architecture here in Zamora. Almost every street has a surprise, and we stopped in amazement to look at many buildings.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Santa Semana</h2>
The week before Easter is a big deal in Spain. No, let me correct that: a <em>huge</em> deal in Spain. In many cities and towns little else happens during Holy Week except Holy Week activities. Seville is said to be the biggest, and Zamora has to have the most intense celebration for a smaller place. Zamora even has a museum dedicated to Santa Semana, which we visited and at which we were amazed/astonished/fascinated!

Starting Palm Sunday, <em>cofradias</em> (essentially religious fraternities) carry huge statues and tableaux through the streets of the city. These <em>pasos</em>, as they are called, depict scenes from the week before the cruxificion of Jesus. They are huge, some of them requiring more than 30 people to carry them. They wend slowly through the streets, watched by huge crowds at every step of the way. The <em>pasos</em> start their journey late in the afternoon and usually take somewhere around 4-5 hours to reach their destination. (On Good Friday the <em>pasos</em> for that day start at 5 a.m. and travel until 2 - 3 a.m. the following morning!) For the members of the <em>cofradias</em>, and for the people watching, this is a mark of their devotion.

The Museo Santa Semana here has many of the <em>pasos</em> used in Zamora's Holy Week processions, as well as the costumes worn by the <em>cofradias</em>, and explanations of the week. It is pretty amazing!

[caption id="attachment_5630" align="aligncenter" width="281"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5630" rel="attachment wp-att-5630"><img class="size-full wp-image-5630" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04585.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="500" /></a> A <em>paso</em> in the Museo Santa Semana. You can see the base here.[/caption]

Under them, 30-35 men walk in unison for hours.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5568" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5568" rel="attachment wp-att-5568"><img class="size-full wp-image-5568" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04595.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> <em>Pasos</em> used in the Santa Semana processions in Zamora.[/caption]

The picture above shows three <em>pasos.</em> As the people under them walk, they move in a slow swinging gait that makes the <em>paso</em> move as though alive.

I thought that all the <em>pasos</em> would be old, but in fact, a number of them were created and introduced into the processions over the last twenty years. Others have been used for over 150 years, and several were old ones re-created and renovated in the last forty-fifty years.

The Muséo Santa Semana also has costumes worn by the members of the <em>cofradias</em> as they process through the streets. Some are, um, eerie:

I have no idea why when the Ku Klux Klan got going in the United States it took its well-known hooded costume from the <em>cofradias</em> of Spain. I wish it hadn't. But then I wish the KKK had never existed.
<h2>The Cathedral</h2>
Zamora's Cathedral is unusual in that it is Romanesque - most cathedrals in Europe were replaced with Gothic buildings as that form of architecture spread from France. But it took hundreds of years to reach Spain and be accepted here; the Seville Cathedral, the largest in the world, is purely Gothic but was built almost 400 years after the first French Gothic cathedral. Zamora's Cathedral itself is interesting, and it has a small but quite nice museum attached. We spent a lot more time here than we planned!

In the museum, we came across this bust of Mary holding Jesus. It's carved in wood and painted. The face is just breathtakingly beautiful.

The Cathedral museum also has a series of beautiful tapestries created in the 1500s that are amazingly well kept.

[caption id="attachment_5619" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5619" rel="attachment wp-att-5619"><img class="size-full wp-image-5619" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04670.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="319" /></a> One of the smaller tapestries, about 15 ft by 15 ft.[/caption]

Here's a detail of one (a detail because they are all huge)!

[caption id="attachment_5620" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5620" rel="attachment wp-att-5620"><img class="size-full wp-image-5620" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04674.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> A detail of the border.[/caption]

Today's interesting tapestry fact: a few years back I did some reading about tapestries and learned that with a tapestry of this quality, a skilled tapestry-maker could do about a square yard <em>per year!</em> These tapestries would take years, with several people working on them at the same time. No wonder they were so valuable.

The Cathedral itself had some interesting aspects. Our favorite was this:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5594" rel="attachment wp-att-5594"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5594" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04697.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="328" /></a>Built into a wall and part of a sepulchre, this was created in 1402, and, for an unknown reason, covered up at some later date. It was rediscovered during a 2010 renovation. The colors are original: this is a 800-year-old unrestored work of art.

And a simple but elegant altarpiece of silver:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5592" rel="attachment wp-att-5592"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5592" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04692.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a>Laurie liked this candlestick.

[caption id="attachment_5591" align="aligncenter" width="281"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5591" rel="attachment wp-att-5591"><img class="size-full wp-image-5591" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04668.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="500" /></a> This thing would light up a stadium.[/caption]

Okay, enough about Zamora for now. We love this place and will definitely return, more than once, we hope.

Okay, two more Zamora pictures.

[caption id="attachment_5582" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5582" rel="attachment wp-att-5582"><img class="size-full wp-image-5582" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04627.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> Laurie would like to find a sweet little girl for whom she can buy a pair of one of these shoes. You choose which color.[/caption]

We thought about buying the boy's outfit for Henry, but, somehow, it didn't seem right for him.[/caption]

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After Zamora we drove four hours south to Trujillo.

We've visited Trujillo at least twice before (we think maybe three times, but we're old: our memories aren't what they used to be). Now, most people would look at Trujillo and give it an afternoon, at most. We understand that, but Trujillo is a perfect example of an old Spanish town, in a region that is harsh; for some reason this place captivates us.

Trujillo is in the region of Extremadura, the western-most area of Spain. The word "extremadura" comes from Latin and means, essentially, "the hard border." That's an accurate name: this is a pretty harsh area. Few crops are grown here; we see cattle, sheep, horses, hogs and goats here. The harshness of this area had a huge effect on South and Central America: Francisco Pizarro, who led the expeditions that conquered Peru in the 1500s, was born and raised in Trujillo. Hernan Cortez, conquerer of Mexico came from near here, and his half-brother, who was in Cortez's army, was born in Trujillo. Many of the <em>conquistadores,</em> as we have come to call them, were from Extremadura. There was nothing here for them, so they went off to conquer other lands.

We first came to Trujillo because I'd read in a guide book that it is a "perfect set piece of a rural Spanish town." Yes, but...this is a living set piece and that makes it really interesting to us. Some pictures are called for, methinks...

Trujillo sits on top of a hill, which means views of the countryside for miles around. There isn't much to see...

[caption id="attachment_5671" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5671" rel="attachment wp-att-5671"><img class="size-full wp-image-5671" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04796.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="113" /></a> I know panorama pictures don't work well in a blog format, but here's one of the countryside surrounding Trujillo. Harsh.[/caption]

The big building is the parador where we stayed.[/caption]

There are miles and miles of stone walls here. The stones came from trying to clear the fields enough to make <em>something</em> grow on them to feed livestock. And I can guarantee that those stones weren't dug up or carried to the fences by some tractor; talk about back-breaking work![/caption]

Most buildings are unpainted, showing the native stone, or white.[/caption]

There's a funny story about the statue of "Pizarro" below. The sculptor, an American named Charles Rumsey, did this statue to honor Hernan Cortez, conqueror of Mexico. Then he went to Mexico to tell them he had this great statue of Cortez he wanted to give to them. Well, Cortez is not exactly a hero in Mexico, given that he conquered the country and essentially enslaved the population and stole all its treasures. So Mexico declined his offer. Then Rumsey came to Extremadura and said he had this great statue of Pizarro, who was born here, and he wanted to give it to Trujillo. Trujillo was happy to take it to honor its most famous native son.

There is <em>always</em> activity here.[/caption]
<h2>Big Goings-on in the Plaza Mayor</h2>
This was a big week for Trujillo, in that the week was a festival associated with the church that sits in the Plaza Mayor. Every night there was a mass in the evening, and every night there was a comedy/puppet show for the kids. Now we couldn't figure out how they were related, but here are the kids ready for the show to start (this picture was taken about 10 o'clock at night):

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5732" rel="attachment wp-att-5732"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5732" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC04778.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a>
The service in the church ended at 10:15 and about 10 seconds later, with a burst of noise and music, the kids' show began, with kids cheering and yelling and having a great time. The second night many kids came in costumes and the MC called them on stage, said a sentence or two to them, got them to make crazy movements or expressions and gave each a certificate of some sort as they left the stage. It was great fun to watch.

We're staying at a Parador again. This one has a new wing and a wing in a 17th century convent. Proof that it was a convent: a torno, which is a turntable on which women could place an unwanted baby or a baby for which they simply couldn't provide, and then turn the torno to send the baby into the convent where the nuns would care for it. Most convents (and convent buildings converted to another use) still have a torno, and most have maintained them as a sign of respect for the past.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5693" rel="attachment wp-att-5693"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5693" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC04918.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="500" /></a>

In fact, tornos now have another use in many active convents. These convents are known for making and selling <em>dulces: </em>sweets, usually cookies and small cakes. When you go to buy <em>dulces</em> you stand at the torno, press a button to summon a nun, and wait. The nun talks to you from behind the torno, takes your order, and tells you the amount it will cost. You put your money on the torno and turn it. Your money goes inside, the <em>dulces</em> come to you. You never see the nun, which is what they want, as they have taken a vow to remain out of public view.

I think that's it for Trujillo. Next is a post about an interesting and enjoyable daytrip we took from here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll forgive you if you've never heard of Monfragüe - we had not until the woman at the Officina de Tourism gave us a brochure on the new Monfragüe National Park, about an hour north of Trujillo. We decided this would make a good day trip, with the bonus of spending time in our air-conditioned car; temps were forecast to be in the upper 90s that day. So off we went.

Driving north showed how hard this land is. No crops growing, just livestock, including the famous pigs that eat acorns and are prized for the flavor from that diet.

Now, one of the things that intrigued us in the brochure was a castle named <em>Castillo Monfragüe</em>, in the park. We wanted to see that and when we reached the place where a road went up to the castillo, we found...a large parking lot, and a sign saying the mini-bus arrives every hour to take folks to the castle. Fortunately, our timing was good and we waited about ten minutes when, sure enough, a mini-bus arrived. We boarded and up the mountain we went.

The site of <em>Castillo Monfragüe</em> is amazing. Situated on a high point of land overlooking the Tajo River, it has controlled passage down the river for thousands of years. There was a fortified site here when the Romans arrived two centuries BC. The Romans fortified it further, as did the Visigoths, the Moors and the Spanish armies. Then the Catholic Church built an <em>ermita</em> here - a site of worship dedicated to Santa Clara. So this place has it all!

In the 95° weather, we took it slow and easy.[/caption]

Here's why this <em>castillo</em> could control passage of opposing armies for thousands of years.

<h2>The Ghost Town of Monfargüe</h2>
After leaving the <em>castillo</em> of Monfargüe, we wanted to take a back road returning to Trujillo. I'd found one on Google Earth that looked interesting so down it we went. Unfortunately, after about a mile it turned to gravel and dirt and we definitely did not want to drive 40 miles on that. So I screeched to a halt, turned around and out of the corner of my eye noticed an unexpectedly large and older building a few hundred yards away. Since we were in the middle of freaking nowhere, I wondered what that building was. I found a road which led to it. What we discovered was a ghost town.

[caption id="attachment_5741" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5741" rel="attachment wp-att-5741"><img class="size-full wp-image-5741" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC04886-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> The railroad station, which now serves as  offices for the railroad.[/caption]

The rest of the "town" is deserted homes and apartment buildings, all built in the same style and likely at the same time. My surmisal is that this was a home for railroad workers and their families, and at some point the railroad closed it down and moved them somewhere else. What remains is truly a ghost town, with just a couple houses on the outskirts that appear to still be occupied.

The main Madrid-Extremadura-Portugal railroad line runs through this station, so at one time it was an important and active place. Now, not much at all. The trains still roar through, but none stop.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Vejer de la Frontera</h2>
We headed south from Trujillo, where it was hot, to Vejer de la Frontera, where it was hotter - approaching 100°. Vejer is a "<em>pueblo blanco</em>" - a white town, so named because it has been here for a thousand or more years and every building in the town is stark white, an effort to live with the hot sun here. There are many <em>pueblos blancos</em> in southern Spain and Vejer has been one of our favorites on two previous stays here. It was small, not overrun with tourists, quiet, with a hotel that we really liked.

This time: not so much. First, I made reservations at the hotel and chose to take an apartment the hotel offered.  It looked beautiful in the pictures and had a private terrace overlooking one side of the city. Great...in theory. When we checked in we found the apartment was tiny (probably not more than 250 sq ft living space, on two levels); the bedroom had one small window that looked out, at foot level, on a busy pedestrian street and another window that looked onto the front door of a house; the stairs in the place reminded me of stairs on a ship: steep and narrow; and...well, it had several other problems.

We immediately went back to the desk and said we were not happy with the room, but the place was full (it has only ten rooms plus the apartment). So we were stuck. We said, "Well, let's see how it goes tonight, see how we feel in the morning." Then we walked out into the quiet town and found it was overrun with tourists. Our previous stays here were in September and now, in late August, tourist season was still in full swing. It was awful. (I am, of course, aware that two of this horde of tourists were Laurie and me, but we're different, I'm sure.) At that point we knew we were not going to stay and I started looking on-line for alternatives. One that we liked: the <em>parador</em> in nearby Arcos de la Frontera - another white town that we'd visited years before and liked a lot - had rooms available.

The night was as bad as we feared. The bedroom was like a tomb, really. We couldn't open the windows much, so it was hot-hot-hot, and claustrophobic to boot. Decision made! I went online and made a reservation at the Arcos <em>parador</em>, we packed up, checked out two days early (credit where credit is due: the manager of the hotel understood our concerns and was gracious and apologetic; she said she would help us find another hotel if we wanted and reduced the price on our room for the night we were there.)

Off we went to Arcos de la Frontera.

[caption id="attachment_5773" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5773" rel="attachment wp-att-5773"><img class="size-full wp-image-5773" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC04920.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="244" /></a> I'm not saying the streets in Vejer are tight, but the receptionist told me to drive down this road to a place where we could unload our bags. I got about a hundred yards down a steep hill on this <em>very</em> narrow street and found this car nicely parked. Now, I've become almost fearless about driving these streets, but I backed up those 100 yards rather than try to get around this car. Laurie kept her head between her knees the entire time.[/caption]

<h2>Arcos de la Frontera</h2>
When we arrived at the Arcos <em>parador</em>, the nicest woman in the whole entire world (or so it seemed to us at the time) checked us in. We decided to opt for an upgraded room with a view and were glad we did. Here's the view from our room's balcony, which was about 6 ft by 20 ft.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5779" rel="attachment wp-att-5779"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5779" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC04940.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="319" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5778" rel="attachment wp-att-5778"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5778" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC04935.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a>

We came to Arcos on one of our first vacations trips to Spain, maybe 16-18 years ago and enjoyed it. It also is a <em>pueblo blanco</em>, set on a high ridge, so the houses pour down one side and a cliff, on which our hotel sat, forms the other side. It's a beautiful town. Going from a dump of a room to a beautiful room with a view didn't hurt, either.

That first time we were here we stumbled onto a small bar/restaurant, Bar San Marcos. It was still there and still great. We had tapas for dinner there the first night and went back for lunch the next. That first night dinner was two tapas each, then two raciones (tapas but a much larger portion, and really, way more food than we needed) and a bottle of wine: $30. Next day's lunch was three courses: a chicken and guacamole salad for a starter, grilled calamari for Laurie and pork steak for me for the main plate, and <em>tocino de cielo</em> (a wonderful custard) for dessert. With two beers each: $24. Really, $24 - not each, total for both of us. This wasn't gourmet food, but it was good and tasty and well-cooked. $24.

We walked around Arcos and just took in the sights, doing nothing special. We'll come back, even if just to stay in that beautiful parador again.

Arcos has some tight streets, too. This is the main street to the <em>parador</em> and a viewpoint at the top of the town. We saw a woman driving a small car stop, cross herself, and then enter this section of road. Really!

Many Spanish churches are of a style called Spanish Baroque, typified by extremely ornate and ostentatious decoration. We saw some of this in Zamora, none in Trujillo (too poor, I think) and lots in Arcos de la Frontera. The apogee (nadir?) of this style is in Santiago de Compostela, but Arcos holds its own.

Note that the two cars farthest away cannot move forward because there's a foot-high wall in front of them. I have no idea what happens when one of those two need to leave. The most amazing thing is that we drove into this parking lot on our arrival and found a parking place right in front of the parador - legal, not blocking anyone, available for $7 per day paid at the parador.[/caption]

A note about the ".<em>..de la Frontera</em>" of these two towns. There are probably thirty or forty towns in southern Spain with "<em>de la Frontera</em>" attached to them. Eight hundred years ago the Spanish monarchs started to push the Islamic Moors from Spain. It took 300 years, culminating in the surrender of Granada to Ferdinand and Isabela in 1492. During that 300 years, the border - the <em>frontera - </em>continually and sporadically moved first south and then east. For years a town could be on that border and so add "<em>de la Frontera</em>" - "on the border."

That's it for Arcos de la Frontera. Although we did not plan to be here, we're glad our Vejer challenge worked out as it did.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Úbeda has an unusual claim to fame: in the middle of Moorish Spain, Úbeda has what many claim to be the most beautiful Renaissance square in all Europe, and has many other Renaissance buildings scattered throughout the city. We've been here a couple times before and knew that Úbeda belonged on our "Greatest Hits of Spain" tour.

I might mention that Úbeda also serves great <em>tapas</em> everywhere; that might have played into our decision to return.

How did it come about that these beautiful Renaissance buildings were built here? In the first half of the 16th century, Francisco de los Cobos, born in Úbeda, became secretary to the Spanish king. But as that king was out of the country almost all of his reign (he was also Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, which took all his time), Cobos was effectively head of the Spanish government from 1533 to 1547. For some odd reason, during that time Cobos found a ton of money to build beautiful buildings in Úbeda. He decided to have those buildings designed by architects who built Renaissance buildings. Once he'd started, several other noble Úbeda families followed suit, trying to keep up with the neighbor; Cobos, that is.

Úbeda is a great place to just walk around, because on almost every street is a surprise building.

This is our third visit to Úbeda and we enjoyed it more than ever. For one thing, we did our homework: we had some excerpts from guidebooks, we visited the <em>Oficina de Tourism</em>, which gave us a terrific map and a guide to walks, with information about many of the buildings we'd see. Úbeda has something like 45 buildings classified as historical monuments and I think we saw at least three-quarters of them.

We stayed at a <em>Parador</em> here, too; our fourth of the trip. We opted for an upgraded room because we knew we could have a room with a small patio in a garden. This is where we relaxed:

<h2>The Renaissance Buildings of Úbeda</h2>
I could probably write a bit about each building we saw, but that would bore you and me, so I'll just throw in some pictures.

The main church burned down centuries ago, but surely was much larger and more ornate than this.[/caption]

San Pablo had Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance aspects, from things being added to it from the 12th century to the 18th.[/caption]

The horseshoe arch reveals its origin in the 10th or 11th century, when the Islamic Moors controlled this part of Spain.[/caption]
<h2>Miscellanous Pictures of Úbeda</h2>
Sitting and talking is a Spanish tradition, particularly in hot weather when no one wants to be in their non-air-conditioned apartment.

Úbeda was <em>hot</em>! The day we arrived was 100° and the next two days in the mid-90s. The whole Spain sojourn has been hot: the day we left Úbeda the forecast was for a high of 89°, which is the coolest day of the trip. We hoped for cooler weather in Segovia, our last stop!

As with the first three stops on our quick tour of Spain, we loved Úbeda. It's not at all a tourist destination, just a beautiful place.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last stop on our "Greatest Hits of Spain" tour is also the place I've known longest in Spain, not counting Madrid: Segovia. It is also a place with which I have some emotional ties.

In the late 1970s/early 1980s I came to Madrid half a dozen times in my work at Boeing. The people I worked with at Iberia Airlines knew I brought an expense account with me, and they loved to go to Segovia for lunch. So the Boeing salesman, Pat Finnigan, three Iberia folks and I would pile into Pat's tiny SEAT 124 and drive 90 minutes to Segovia for lunch at a famous restaurant there, Duque. Pat Finnigan was by no small measure the best person I ever worked for or with, and we became good friends. He died four years ago, and I can tell you that I felt his presence the whole time we were in Segovia, especially when Laurie and I had lunch at Duque.

The other connection I have with Segovia is Queen Isabel - she of Isabel and Ferdinand, Christopher Columbus and all that. After I went to Madrid I started to read about Spain and quickly became interested in Isabel, reading everything I could about her. She conducted her monarchy in an almost revolutionary way. The Segovia connection comes because she lived here for quite a while, and was here when her father died. To cement her claim to the throne, she got the local church and government officals to crown her in a church in Segovia's Plaza Mayor. It's possible to walk the same streets she walked, and stand in that Plaza Mayor. History; gotta love it.
<h2>The Big Three</h2>
Segovia is known for three monuments: the amazing Roman aqueduct, the castle (actually, the Alcázar), and the Cathedral.
<h2>Segovia Sights - the Aqueduct</h2>
Pretty impressive. The aqueduct was built around 100 AD, when Spain was part of the Roman Empire. It stands 98 ft high at its highest point, and consists of 167 arches. Built of granite blocks, it uses no mortar to hold it together. It has been reconstructed a couple times, but is essentially as it was when finished.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5920" rel="attachment wp-att-5920"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5920" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC07767.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5921" rel="attachment wp-att-5921"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5921" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC07787.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5922" rel="attachment wp-att-5922"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5922" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC07794.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5923" rel="attachment wp-att-5923"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5923" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC07799.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a>I first saw the aqueduct in 1980, give or take a year. It still carried water into the old part of Segovia then. That stopped about ten years later, but think about that: this thing carried water into Segovia for somewhere around 1800 years. Amazing.
<h2>Segovia Sights - the Alcazar</h2>
This building has historic significance: in 1474, the king of Castille and León (then the biggest and most powerful part of Spain) died, and his daughter Isabel claimed the throne. She was living in the Alcázar at the time and she knew that her half-brother would also claim the throne, so it was important that she be crowned first. She gathered the local aristocrats and government officials, left the Alcázar and they all walked to Iglesia St. Miguel, in the Plaza Mayor, where she was crowned Queen of Castille and León - effectively, Queen of Spain. (Her half-brother did, indeed, also claim the throne; it took a couple battles between the armies of Isabel and Juan for her to fully claim her title.)

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5929" rel="attachment wp-att-5929"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5929" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC05514.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="500" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5928" rel="attachment wp-att-5928"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5928" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC05516-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="290" /></a>
Inside the Alcázar is a museum and rooms furnished in period furniture. It's interesting, but as we had visited it on a previous visit, we skipped it this trip.
<h2>Segovia Sights - the Cathedral</h2>
The Segovia Cathedral is the last major church in Europe built in Gothic style. It's huge, but honestly, not all that interesting.

<h2>Other Segovia sights - the <em>paseo</em></h2>
My friend Pat Finnigan said he believed  that Segovia keeps the tradition of the <em>paseo</em>, the evening walk, better than any other Spanish town. Starting about 7 p.m. folks start the walk, between the Plaza Mayor and the Aquaduct. It starts to peter out about 10 p.m.

[caption id="attachment_5917" align="aligncenter" width="281"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5917" rel="attachment wp-att-5917"><img class="size-full wp-image-5917" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC05458.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="500" /></a> Segovia's famous Roman aqueduct, with the <em>paseo</em> in full swing.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5918" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5918" rel="attachment wp-att-5918"><img class="size-full wp-image-5918" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC05466.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> It's not all walking - sometimes you just have to sit and rest and watch the world go by.[/caption]
<h2>Other Segovia Pictures</h2>
[caption id="attachment_5931" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=5931" rel="attachment wp-att-5931"><img class="size-full wp-image-5931" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC05515.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> Iglesia de la Vera Cruz ("true cross"), outside Segovia. We walked out to visit it. Built in the 1100s, it is said to have once contained a piece of the "true cross." If every place that says it had a piece of the "true cross" really did have a piece, that cross must have been 800 ft tall.[/caption]

This wall decoration is <em>everywhere</em> in Segovia and we loved finding buildings decorated this way. I'll do a separate post on this beautiful art.[/caption]
<h2>The Route into Segovia</h2>
Laurie believes that I try to take the narrowest route possible into any town we visit. That is, of course, completely wrong. In Segovia, it wasn't my fault. I knew exactly how to get to our hotel on the Plaza Mayor, having done it a few times. Besides, the GPS agreed with me on the route. So we arrived at the main entrance to the city and, whoops:

I know another way.[/caption]

See? Nothing to it! I've done this enough to not get puckered up over driving down streets like this. I've come to understand that I'm not the first driver to go through these streets and if the others could do it, I can do it. Laurie politely disagrees.

I've rambled on enough about this wonderful city. We stayed three nights and headed back to France. I'll do one more post about the <em>escrafiado </em>walls of Segovia, and maybe one Spain wrap-up post. Honestly, if you could visit only one small town in Spain, Segovia would be my recommendation. Of course, you should also visit Toledo, Trujillo, Úbeda, Zamora, Santiago de Compostela, Arcos de la Frontera and any other place that looks interesting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Esgrafiado</em>, applied to architecture, describes the technique of creating 3-d patterns on walls. We loved seeing buildings with this decoration. Segovia must have hundreds of them; we saw maybe half. Once we'd noticed them, we searched them out.

Although I don't know - yet - exactly how these <em>esgrafiado</em> - walls are created, essentially what happens is that a smooth surface of some kind of plaster or cement is laid on the wall and the design then cut out of it. The result is a smooth design on a rough surface where the material has been removed. Every design we saw was unique; no duplicates as near as we could tell.

<em>Esgrafiado</em> buildings also exist in Barcelona, but Segovia must be the prime place to see them in Spain. Here are pictures of some Segovia <em>esgafiado</em> buildings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We spent six days in Elmsford as we returned from France. I gotta say that having Elmsford to break up the Seattle - Paris journey is fabulous. Instead of a 11-hour Paris - Seattle flight, we have a one 7-1/2 hour flight (Paris - JFK), a six hour time change and six days to recover from it, then a six hour flight back to Seattle. And, best of all, of course, we get to spend time with Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry. Pretty hard to beat that, I gotta say.

And to add to the benefits, Craig has become an aficionado and expert of tiki drinks, so we were able to try out his Mai-Tais, Twelve-Mile-Limits (Laurie's favorite), Fogcutters, Dr. Funks, and something else which we've forgotten. Good thing we had to go up only one flight of stairs to our beds...

But I know all you want to see is pictures of the New York Z's, so here they are:

Craig and Annie have to be the best hosts in the world. They let us stay as long as we want (we haven't pushed to see just how long that would remain the case), they serve us great food <em>and</em> tiki drinks, and put up with us doing not much. Well, okay, me not doing much; they have a flower circle in the front yard that Laurie has adopted and spends hours working on.

Thanks to them giving us the best possible way to end a great vacation. A <em>GREAT </em>vacation!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I didn’t think I’d post anything about our 2019 sojourn, but since we like using the blog as a way to remember our trips, I’ve decided to do one for this year’s travels, and maybe both readers of this blog will enjoy it a bit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This trip germinated last Christmas when we were here in Elmsford. We had already decided that we would drive our old Toyota RAV4 to Elmsford so Craig and Annie could have a second car. Then one night we were sitting around testing Craig’s Tiki-drink-mixing skills (he passed <i>summa cum laude</i>) when Annie mentioned that she could attend a conference in Paris in late May. Immediately, Laurie and I said, “We’ll take care of the kids so you and Craig can both go and have a vacation in Paris.” It took Craig and Annie about 3 seconds to accept that offer. So here we are.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We took seven and a half days to drive here; we didn’t exactly do any sight-seeing on the way. It was fun, really, with the exception of one day that was less than enjoyable. Rather than doing a day-by-day post I’ll smush the driving days into one post. I promise it won’t be too long; boring, yes, but not too long.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Day 1: Seattle to Superior Montana. </b></span><span class="s1">422 miles, about 7-½ hours of driving</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This was a pretty easy drive, though tied for the longest of the whole trip. Why Superior, Montana? Well, it was a good place, distance- and time-wise, to stop. And, oddly enough, it has a motel that gets great reviews: the Big Sky Lodge. The Big Sky is right out of the 60s, except that it has been updated, had comfortable beds and was immaculately clean and well kept up. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Superior (population 800) is not exactly a center of the culinary art; there are only two restaurants. One is in the kitchen/cafeteria of an unused school and that’s what we chose. “Food like your mother used to make” is their motto and while not exactly true (neither my mother nor Laurie’s made food like this), it was, well, copious might be the operative word. Gotta love that gravy!</span></p>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6056" rel="attachment wp-att-6056"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6056" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2695.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="540" /></a>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After a walk along the river, we decided to have a nightcap at the lounge of the other restaurant. We ordered up a couple martinis which were just fine and asked for the bill. $6. Not for each, for both of them. Now that is a personal best for low-cost martinis: $3 each. We still don’t know why we didn’t order another couple rounds…</span></p>
Superior is the county seat and has a beautiful county government building.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6055" rel="attachment wp-att-6055"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6055" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2691.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="247" /></a>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anyway, Superior was a great place for our first night on the road.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Day 2: Superior to Billings, Montana. </b>403 miles, about 7 hours of driving.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yes, we drove the whole day and never got out of Montana; this is a BIG state. In Billings we stayed at an independent hotel, the Riversage, which was quite nice and turned out to be our favorite hotel of the trip. It is well-appointed, has a nice comfortable feel to it and because it is near the hospital and away from downtown or the freeway, was quiet as can be. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But our favorite part of Billings was dinner at Uberbrew, a brew pub, and our favorite part of that was our server, a woman with more energy that any three people we know combined. She was just a kick. we sat at the counter where she was working and talked to her a lot. When we left she hugged us both and said to Laurie, “I want your skin, I want your figure. Keep it up, sister. Keep it up!” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Day 3: Billings to Rapid City, South Dakota, with a side trip to Mt. Rushmore. </b>373 miles, about seven hours of driving, including a long Mt. Rushmore side trip.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The highlight of this day was, of course, Mt. Rushmore. It is well worth the side trip and we recommend it to everyone.</span></p>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6054" rel="attachment wp-att-6054"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6054" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC08441.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="329" /></a>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rapid City impressed us. It has a downtown full of beautiful old stone and brick buildings. We later found a walking tour of downtown and said, “We should come back to Rapid City to explore.” But you know what? I doubt that will happen. It’s a long ways from any place we’ll be in the future, and a long drive to get there. But we did enjoy a stroll after dinner to look at those beautiful buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Day 4: Rapid City, South Dakota to Sioux City, Iowa.</b> 422 miles, about eight hours of driving.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not much to see in this part of the country. This was a long day because it was just not very interesting. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Day 5: Sioux City, Iowa to Davenport, Iowa.</b> 367 miles, 6-1/2 hours.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another day of being in one state all day long. It ended in Davenport, Iowa, and the day did have some interesting aspects. First, large parts of Iowa were really pretty, which we did not expect; rolling hills, trees and grass. Second, you should know that Davenport is part of the “Quad Cities,” which is, oddly enough, made up of five cities. Go figure. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The highlight of the day was dinner at the “Machine Shed” in Davenport. Really. “Dedicated to the American Farmer,” the Machine Shed is decorated with every farm poster and implement you can think of and the servers wear farmers' overalls. Now, since we were definitely in beef country, it was rib-eye steaks for both of us. But first, martinis, which were <em>really</em> good ones. When we ordered our steaks, the server said that we got our choice of two appetizers to share, so we got coleslaw and baked apples; a basket of great bread came with the meal, too. The steaks arrived with a big bowl of corn. And of course we had to top it off with an apple dumpling with ice cream, which turned out to be some farmer’s entire crop of apples and a gallon of ice cream. We were able to waddle back to the hotel without assistance, so we figured it was a successful evening. Honestly, though, the Machine Shed was a hit with us; a great meal and I think the whole thing - drinks, steaks, sides, dessert, tip and all - was $72.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6057" rel="attachment wp-att-6057"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6057" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2733.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="540" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6058" rel="attachment wp-att-6058"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6058" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2736.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="540" /></a></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Day 6: Davenport, Iowa to Maumee, Ohio (just outside Toledo).</b> 396 miles, about nine hours of driving with a big delay.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Okay, ya gotta have one bad day on a trip this long and day six was it. Chronologically:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li2"><span class="s1">The drive on I-80 toward Chicago was awful: rough road, more huge trucks than cars, all going either slower or faster than we wanted to go. It was three hours of dodging crazy car drivers and crazier truck drivers.</span></li>
 	<li class="li2"><span class="s1">As we approached the Indiana line we saw a signboard that said there had been an “incident” just past the border and we could expect delays. Yes, indeed: it took us 2 hours, 40 minutes to go 11 miles. There were so many trucks that at times, we could not see another car. When we got to a toll booth, I asked the toll-taker what was going on and she told us: a tanker truck carrying thousands of gallons of honey had overturned and spilled everything. </span></li>
 	<li class="li2"><span class="s1">After getting through that mess, the rest of the day was in and out of work zones that reduced the two or three lanes of the interstate to one; slow going.</span></li>
 	<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Laurie got something in her eye. By the end of the day she could hardly open it. </span></li>
 	<li class="li2"><span class="s1">We got to our destination and saw a huge Krogers store near-by. “Ah,” we said, “we can get some eye-wash for Laurie and sandwiches from their deli.” However, no eye wash was to be found there, and we had unknowingly crossed into the Easter time zone, which meant it wasn’t a little after 6 p.m., it was a little after 7 p.m. and Krogers’ deli closed at - you guessed it - 7 p.m.</span></li>
 	<li class="li2"><span class="s1">I found some salads on the shelf at Krogers and that was dinner. We opened a bottle of wine, drank it to the dregs, crawled into bed and called it a day. Not a good day, but a day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Day 7: Maumee, Ohio to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.</b> 360 miles, about six hours of driving.</span></p>
A big event: we drove by Lorain, Ohio, the hometown of our wonderful friend in France, Jamie Rufin. Next time, we'll even stop there. Maybe.
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The biggest surprise for us was how beautiful Pennsylvania is. Forested hills and valleys, rivers and streams; we loved it. In Lewisburg we found the best of the chain hotels we stayed in, but there was nothing else special about our night here. Still, we want to return to this area to explore, and as it’s half a day from our Elmsford Zumsteg base, I suspect we’ll be able to do that someday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Day 8: Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to Elmsford, New York, our home away from home!</b> A measly 244 miles and 4 hours of driving.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Half a day of driving, and pretty easy navigation. But the New Jersey drivers - holy cow. The high point was driving on a four-lane interstate with most drivers (including those huge trucks) going 80 mph, changing lanes every three or four seconds and thinking nothing of pulling up to two feet behind us. At that point we saw a sign, “Report Aggressive Drivers #77.” Are you kidding me? We would have needed an intercom to do that. We would have just read them the license plate number of every car on the road. I am sure there were people that went home that night and raged about that stupid car with Washington plates that drove at the speed limit and stayed in the right-hand lane the whole time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But we made it to Elmsford and were glad to be there. Geeze, were we happy to see Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry! Total mileage: 2,987 plus a few for getting to and from restaurants. Honestly, we enjoyed the whole trip except for that one day. This is, indeed, quite a country we live in. We hope we can see more of it, and spend more time in some places we whizzed through.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Off the Hook!</h2>
Phew! Craig and Annie returned a couple nights ago and we're now officially guests and not grandkid-sitters. We actually can sleep past 6 a.m.! A few words about our stint as grandkid sitters: "Holy cow, it's hard!" Both kids would wake  up about 6 a.m. and need some breakfast. Clara then would get ready for the school bus, which arrives about 7:45. We'd then take Henry to three hours of daycare about an hour later. Pick him up at noon, then have a "quiet time" (also known as a nap; Henry refuses to take a nap but seemed fine with having quiet time with us and then sleeping for an hour. Semantics are important!) Clara returned about 3:15. If the weather was good, they'd play outside with friends. If the weather was bad - and it was bad much of the week - we'd all stay inside.

I think what strikes us most is the almost constant requests for our time, "Grandma/Granddad, can you play with me?" "Grandma/Granddad, can I &lt;insert something that Craig and Annie would never allow&gt;?", "Grandma... Granddad... Grandma... Granddad... Grandma... Granddad..." Laurie said at one point she thought the cats were meowing "Grandma..."

Henry is quite vocal (that might be the understatement of the year) and has bunch of funny sayings. "Oh, I did not know that," "I almost forgot," "Not right now," (whenever he doesn't want to do something that we want him to do). So we definitely had some laughs.

Clara has been taking gymnastics classes and it shows: she can hardly walk ten feet without doing a cartwheel or somersault or flip. She has a balance beam (that sits on the ground) and a horizontal bar outside and she can do all sorts of amazing things on them. It's really fun to watch her do her thing.

Overall, it was fine, excepting that Grandma and Granddad are not used to being "on-call" 24/7.  Clara was just great helping us, particularly when we didn't understand what Henry was asking for (which frustrated him and us). The kids were over-the-top happy to see Craig and Annie when they returned, and we were pretty happy too. But, you know what? We'd do it again in a minute. Although mentally draining, we had a ton of good times and fun with Clara and Henry.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The objective of this trip was to bring a car back to Craig and Annie; they could use a second car and we had an extra. Yesterday, Craig got all the legal stuff done and, with a little help from Clara and Henry, our 2005 Rav4 became an official New York resident:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6119" rel="attachment wp-att-6119"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6119" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSC08559-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6121" rel="attachment wp-att-6121"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6121" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSC08569-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a>
<h2>Kingston</h2>
We wanted to get out of Craig and Annie's hair the day after they returned, to give them some Grandma- and Granddad-free time to re-connect with Clara and Henry. Craig suggested we drive to Kingston, about 90 minutes north, with a stop at a "rails-to-trails" bridge across the Hudson. Since they now have two cars (see above), off we went.

The bridge across the Hudson was surprising. We figured there might be a dozen people there, but no; the place was crowded with folks. The bridge, formerly a railroad bridge, is the longest and tallest walking trail bridge in the world. It provided a beautiful view of the Hudson River.

After walking across the bridge and back - along with hundreds of folks walking, running, strolling, sauntering, riding bicycles/scooters/a unicyle (yes!) - we headed to Kingston, about twenty minutes north. We found the restaurant Craig recommended and had an excellent lunch. Then we walked around town and were gob-smacked at what we saw. This town (about 22,000 folks) has many beautiful buildings: commercial, residential, governmental and churches. We just loved it.

First, four historic buildings; the last picture explains their connection to history.

Now, a random collection of buildings we saw on a short walk around one area of Kingston:

I could get into politics if I could find a group with the right idea about where to meet:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6141" rel="attachment wp-att-6141"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6141" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSC08525.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a>

And one last eye-opener: the cemetery at the Dutch Reformed Church of Kingston. The flags, placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution for Memorial Day, mark the graves of men who served in the Revolutionary Army. There are <em>seventy</em> in this cemetery alone.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6138" rel="attachment wp-att-6138"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6138" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSC08516.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></a>

We loved Kingston and plan to return for a few days sometime.

Although we've come to Elmsford many times over the last five years, this was the first time we've had a chance to get out and see how beautiful this area is, and how history pokes its head up all the time. We're already planning some trips to see and absorb this country.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We stayed home this year and decided to make a couple local trips, here in the good ol' U.S of A. We had a great time! After our cross-country drive, we took two short trips to places about as different as could be, and loved both of them. Both were breathtakingly beautiful in completely different ways.

Our first trip was in late-August. We spent a couple days in the Redwoods of northern California and at Ft. Bragg, farther south but still in northern California. The second ramble was to northeastern Oregon, where we visited the 37,000 acre Zumwalt Prairie, one of a few remaining areas of Northwest Prairie Grass. First, the Redwoods.
<h2>Northern California Redwoods</h2>
Me and the Redwoods go way back. When I was growing up just south of San Francisco, my family camped in the Redwoods many times. I remember enjoying the camping, but I can't say that I enjoyed it because I was in the Redwoods; more that I was camping, getting dirty, falling in creeks and rivers and having some fun. Then Laurie and I spent a few days in the Redwoods on our honeymoon, some mumble-mumble-mumble years ago. When Derek and Craig were young and we were still camping, we came here for a few days. It was then that I began to really appreciate how beautiful these groves were.

In 2014, we met our friends Mary and Gilles in Napa and drove up to the Redwoods. On that trip these trees just bowled me over. I said then that walking into groves of Redwoods is like stepping inside a Gothic cathedral in France: columns stretching upward almost out of sight, near-silence, even when there are people in the grove, beautiful sights no matter where you look. When we left the redwoods that trip, we vowed to return soon. Only took us five years...

We stayed in Crescent City, which is the northernmost city on the California coast, just 15-20 miles from the Oregon border. Crescent City is not going to be our favorite town in the world, but we found a nice seafood restaurant - more like a seafood hut -, an excellent brewpub and a fine walk along the ocean, so we were fine.

The tallest of the Redwoods is named Hyperion, a couple inches short of 380 feet tall. Many of the Redwoods reach more than 300 ft into the sky. Can't see Hyperion, though, nor half a dozen trees over 350 feet discovered in the last 25 years; to keep tourists from mobbing them and trampling the forest, their locations are secret.

But you can see many of these giants, gathered together in groves that will take your breath away (and put a crick in your neck from looking up). Many trees we did see are around 300 ft tall.

This grove is unusual in that because it is near a river that floods every few years and carries away all the brush on the forest floor, trees here are visible from the very bottom way up until they disappear in the forest ceiling. Other groves have lots of underbrush that hides the tree bottoms.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6189" align="aligncenter" width="422"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6189" rel="attachment wp-att-6189"><img class="wp-image-6189" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08624.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="750" /></a> This is a big tree, but far from the biggest we saw. It has a diameter of maybe 15 ft; we saw trees with diameters approaching 25 ft.[/caption]

I can write about these trees, and I can talk about them, but really, you have to go see them if you want to know how beautiful they are. We're looking forward to returning and spending more time among them.
<h2>Ft. Bragg</h2>
After the Redwoods we drove down the coast to Ft. Bragg. Ft. Bragg is an interesting old place, and we had found what looked like a good place to stay. In fact, it was a <em>great</em> place to stay. Almost every room has a view of the ocean, with nothing but sand and grass between the hotel and the surf. We ponied up a little extra for a room on the top (of two) floors for a little better view. It had a balcony and a big door opening out onto it; we never closed that door while were there, so we could listen to the surf all night long. Nice place, for sure.

We arrived in Ft. Bragg on a beautiful day in late August. When we commented on the day to the fellow who checked us in, he agreed and added, "Hottest day of the year today: 73°." Whoo, a scorcher!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Northeastern Oregon - Joseph and the Zumwalt Prairie</h1>
For our next ramble we could hardly have chosen a place more different than the forests and coastline of Northern California. Joseph, population about 800, sits in northeastern Oregon, 10 minutes from the thriving town of Enterprise (population: 2,000; also the home of Terminal Gravity Brewing, an excellent brewer of craft beers). Although Joseph has gained a reputation as an artists' colony and has several art fairs through the year, there isn't much here really.

Both Joseph and Enterprise, though, sit in a beautiful corner of Oregon. The Wallowa Mountains border the south and west, the east has Hell's Canyon, and to the north, the Zumwalt Prairie. In a March visit to nearby Baker City, a resident there had told us we <em>have </em>to see Zumwalt Prairie and, after seeing it, we understand why he told us that.

Zumwalt Prairie - named after the now-long-gone town of Zumwalt, which was named after the also-now-long-gone resident Henry Zumwalt - consists of 37,000 acres of prairie land owned by the Nature Conservancy. Some of that land was donated to the Conservancy, some purchased by the organization. It is one of just a few areas that has Northwest Prairie grass in its original state. Although the prairie has fences and a few cows, and at least one barn, it is largely pristine. And it is beautiful.

In fact, there isn't much to see at Zumwalt Prairie, in the usual tourist sense of "see," that is, looking at interesting things. There are a few buildings, some fences, some cattle wandering around and not much else. There are also miles and miles of beautiful land covered by that prairie grass, and we found the prairie as beautiful as the Redwoods, in a completely different way.
<h2>Our Accommodations</h2>
Now, given that there are only 800 people living in Joseph, one cannot expect a wide range of places to stay. There are a couple of motels that looked just fine, but we settled on a place with character and lots of it. This was one of those times where you hold your breath when you open the room door for the first time, but this time it worked out fine. It was, indeed, full of character - "rustic" <em>might</em> be the word. But it was fun and funky and the owner, Scott, was a character himself.

Marv and Becky were right next door and we shared a deck, so that was the site for morning coffee and evening cocktails. From here we had a view of the Wallowa Mountains to the south.[/caption]
<h2>The Duckett Barn</h2>
This is one of just a few structures on the Zumwalt Prairie. At the Duckett Barn is a small display set up by the Nature Conservancy, with information about the preserve. We also had a personal interest in seeing the barn: we were with our Portland friends Marv and Becky and Becky's family is friends with the descendants of the Ducketts who built this barn. <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6218" rel="attachment wp-att-6218">

We suspect the corrals and cattle loading ramps are still used, as there are a few cattle grazing in the area.[/caption]
<h2>Prairie Pictures</h2>
These were taken from near the Duckett barn. You can see that, except for the fences, there are no signs that people have ever been here. It was, as you can imagine, as quiet as can be - only the sound of the wind stirring the grass.

After spending time around Duckett barn, we drove down a rather rough road to reach Hell's Canyon. Here's the road, with Hell's Canyon in the distance.

[caption id="attachment_6217" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6217" rel="attachment wp-att-6217"><img class="size-full wp-image-6217" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08751.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /></a> Not exactly a great road! In the distance are the mountains that form the east side of Hell's Canyon. At this point, Hell's canyon is almost 8,500 feet deep - deeper than the Grand Canyon by a fair amount.[/caption]

The second day in Joseph we decided that what we wanted to do most that day was go back to Zumwalt Prairie. This time Laurie and I walked up a trail to get a panoramic view. It was amazing.

[caption id="attachment_6223" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6223" rel="attachment wp-att-6223"><img class="size-full wp-image-6223" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08793.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /></a> The trail...[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6221" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6221" rel="attachment wp-att-6221"><img class="size-full wp-image-6221" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08806.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="721" /></a> The view. From halfway up the hill, Laurie and I could see the Duckett barn off a ways.[/caption]

Honestly, I don't know how to describe or account for how we feel about this area. It is a completely different beauty than we saw in the Redwoods, but we love it every bit as much. There is something special about the isolation and lack of human intervention in this land, about the miles and miles of prairie grass pretty much undisturbed by us people. We are looking forward to returning to northeastern Oregon and I suspect we'll do a lot of what we did this trip: sit and absorb the beauty and quiet of Zumwalt Prairie.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We made one more trip this year - to Elmsford NY for Halloween. Craig and Annie's neighborhood really does Halloween big: the majority of the houses are decorated, from a few pumpkins to full-yard displays of ghosts, skeletons, ghouls, laser light shows and so forth. The night starts with a neighborhood party and then everyone goes out for goodies. This year the number of kids was down because it was colder and wetter than it has been, but Craig and Annie had somewhere near 200 kids come to their door. Way, way fun!

Now, this is going to be a long post so I want to first put in some pictures of Clara and Henry at Halloween. I apologize that the picture quality is not so great; I was taking videos and the quality of a still from the video is not the best.

<h2>Rambles around Elmsford</h2>
For a couple reasons we saw more interesting places around Elmsford on this trip than on all our previous trips combined: with Henry in all-day Pre-K, Craig had more time to do stuff with us; and with two cars (see: <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=6117">A second car</a>) we were able to get out on our own much more.
<h2>Storm King Art Center</h2>
We learned about Storm King Art Center when we saw a PBS Newshour segment on the artist Andy Goldsworthy and a wall he was building at a museum in Kansas City. The wall -  a low slate wall hand-built of local materials - fascinated us and in reading more about him, we learned that he's built a number of these walls as art installations and that one is at the Storm King Art Center, about 45 minutes from Craig and Annie.

Now it turned out that on Saturday, Annie needed some quiet time to work on a proposal so Craig loaded us and Clara and Henry into the car and off we went. Storm King is a 500-acre park dedicated to outdoor modern sculpture. Now I can tell you that Laurie and I have not been great aficionados of modern art, but I can also tell you that after seeing Storm King, we're getting there, especially as it relates to sculpture. I think the setting for large abstract art makes a huge difference, and Storm King has so much space people can see the pieces from afar, from close up, from all around them.

First we took a tram around the park, which was definitely Clara and Henry's high point of the day. From it we saw all the installations, many of which interested us greatly. Then we went back to see Andy Goldsworthy's wall. That was definitely the high point of the day for us.

I heard someone say that it actually goes underwater across the bottom of the pond but I didn't dive in to verify that.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6276" rel="attachment wp-att-6276"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6276" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08963.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /></a>

[caption id="attachment_6279" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6279" rel="attachment wp-att-6279"><img class="wp-image-6279 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08976.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /></a> On the other side of the pond, the wall climbs a hillside.[/caption]

Why we love Andy Goldsworthy's wall we can't explain. I guess that's art: you like it or you don't and sometimes (often?) you can't explain why you like it or don't. We hope to see more of Mr. Goldsworthy's work.

Storm King has about 150 pieces of art spread throughout its 500 acres. This means that these sculptures - often big and sometimes huge - can be seen as they should be seen: in the open, with plenty of space around them.

I really liked this one, but then, I've always liked Calder. You can see the space for these sculptures in the Art Center.[/caption]

We liked this one a lot, too.[/caption]

Look at this!"[/caption]

We loved Storm King, and thank Craig and Clara and Henry for taking us there. We'll be back, that's for certain.
<h2>The Great Jack o'Lantern Blaze</h2>
At the other end of the art spectrum is the Great Jack o'Lantern Blaze: more carved pumpkins than you thought could be gathered in one place. Held on the historic Van Cortland estate about 30 minutes north of Elmsford, it comprises over 10,000 (!) carved pumpkins. Now, maybe 2/3rds of them are not really pumpkins, but something that looks just like a carved pumpkin and assembled into: a forty-foot tall Statue of Liberty, dinosaurs, a unicorn, Washington Irving's Headless Horseman bridge, a sea serpent and many other installations. All the walkways and many of the installations had real carved pumpkins. Since this event goes for six weeks, those carved pumpkins have to be replaced as they spoil and so the organization has 1,000 volunteers who carve pumpkins - usually in amazing shapes.

[caption id="attachment_6288" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6288" rel="attachment wp-att-6288"><img class="wp-image-6288 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08919.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="674" /></a> Laurie, Craig and Clara checking out the Statue of Liberty, made of carved pumpkins.[/caption]

Lest you think this is a small gathering of folks, I'd guess there were 5,000 people there on a cold Thursday night.  You can't see it in the pictures, but there were crowds everywhere. Some in-the-head calculating makes me think they brought in about $100,000 that night alone, and the Blaze runs for almost six weeks. Makes me want to start carving pumpkins for a Renton Blaze next year...
<h2>Union Church, Pocantico Hills</h2>
Pocantico Hills is an area dominated by the Rockefeller estate. In fact, at the end of the 19th century, the Rockefellers owned some 4,000 acres here, including the village of Pocantico Hills.

In 1921 John D. Rockefeller, Jr. commissioned the building of the Union Church of Pocantico Hills. By itself, it is a beautiful church.

[caption id="attachment_6294" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6294" rel="attachment wp-att-6294"><img class="wp-image-6294 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Union-Church-1024x679.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="424" /></a> The Union Church of Pocantico Hills shows an architectural feature we love and see often here: beautiful stone construction.[/caption]

In 1948, John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s wife, Abby Aldridge, died, and her son Nelson Rockefeller (an avid collector and enthusiast of modern art) tried to get Henri Matisse to do a rose window in the church in her memory. Matisse was not enthusiastic about the idea and was in poor health, but as Abby had supported him for years, he acceded and started designing the window. He completed the design two days before he died. His daughter carried out the design in stained glass and supervised the installation. The rose window is not big - maybe 8 ft across - but it is just lovely.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6293" rel="attachment wp-att-6293"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6293" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC09001.jpg" alt="" width="495" height="500" /></a>

After the death of his father, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., in 1960, Nelson asked Marc Chagall to create a window in his memory. Chagall was delighted to do so, partly because he revered Henri Matisse and was honored to have a window in the same location as a Matisse work, but also because the Rockefellers had supported him too. He created this window, on the Good Samaritan theme, because he looked upon John D. Rockefeller, Jr. as a good samaritan for all his philanthropic work.

In 1961 Michael, a son of Nelson Rockefeller, disappeared while on an anthropological expedition in New Guinea. Nelson asked Marc Chagall to create a stain-glass window in his memory, which Chagall did. Then over the years Chagall did seven more side windows memorializing other members of the Rockefeller family. In this small and simple church (it holds about 120 people), these windows steal the scene. Unfortunately, before I could take pictures of these side windows, the guide pointed out that photography is not allowed, so I had to make due with my two "stolen" pictures. I guess if you want to see the other eight Marc Chagall windows here, you'll just have to make a trip to Pocantico Hills. Trust me, it's worth it.
<h2>Kykuit</h2>
I mentioned above that Pocantico Hills is the location of the Rockefeller family estate; Kykuit (pronounced "cake-oot") is the name of the actual estate. Once over 4,000 acres, it is now around 350, the rest having been given to cities and the county for use by residents as parks and forests open to the public for hiking, walking and biking (one day we took a walk with Craig through a section of the estate that has been donated).

The Historic Hudson Valley organization offers tours through Kykuit, ranging from an hour to three hours long. We decided that would be pretty interesting and signed up for the three-hour tour.

The main house was started in 1902 by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. After six years (and a fire), it was occupied, but John D. did not like its layout and had it rebuilt, finally being completed in 1913. It has forty rooms and twenty bathrooms, many formal and informal gathering areas, although looking at the "informal" areas, I suspect a suit and tie was required for men to enter them; informal, indeed. The building is, um, rather nice. About the mansion it's said, "It's what God would have built, if only He had the money."

The tour included the interior (no pictures) and gardens (pictures allowed). Nelson Rockefeller lived here and used the interiors and gardens to display his enormous collection of modern art.

Not too bad a view.[/caption]

The tour ended in the carriage house, which had a collection of the horse-drawn carriages used by the Rockefellers, and a number of their cars, including Nelson's Chrysler used when he was governor. I particularly liked this one:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6315" rel="attachment wp-att-6315"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6315" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC09035-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a>

I might point out that the tour did not include a visit to the "Playhouse." The Playhouse has a full gymnasium, indoor swimming pool, game rooms and goodness knows what else and is approximately 48,000 square feet. "Playhouse" indeed.

Rockefellers - now the fourth generation - still live in houses on the remaining land. David Rockefeller, the last of the third generation, died in 2017 and his land and house recently sold. For $32 million. We were too late to enter a bid, unfortunately. Then objects from his estate were sold, mostly art. That auction raised—wait for it —$835 million, all of which went to charitable organizations David had supported while he was alive. Notable items: a Picasso at $115 million, a Monet at $85 million and a Matisse at $81 million.

Kykuit was pretty amazing; well worth the time and price of the tour. We'd like to go on a sunny day, but even in the mist and clouds, it impresses.
<h2>Wrapping It Up...</h2>
Great trip. We're learning more and more about the Hudson River Valley and its many attractions. The area is beautiful, that's for sure.

As always Craig and Annie were the best of hosts. We love visiting them in Elmsford and are already looking forward to our next trip there.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Maybe it was cabin fever or because we had to cancel a three-month France trip this summer, but when our friends Eric and Shelley asked if we would like to visit them during their stay in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where they were working from "home" (a beautiful old condo actually within the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park), we thought about it for, oh, two or three seconds before saying "YES, INDEED!"

Then we decided to add a ramble around Wyoming to our trip. Fifteen years ago I did a lot of consulting work in Cheyenne and traveled there almost every week for a couple years. I saw much of the state and knew that while Wyoming has miles and miles of nothing but sagebrush, it also has lots of spectacular scenery and an interesting history. Wyoming also has what we call "Geology in Your Face;" some amazing geological events occurred in the state and they are easily seen and appreciated. So away we went.
<h2>Our Itinerary</h2>
Before I get to the many exciting things we did, here's our itinerary:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Day 1: Superior, Montana, an overnight stay. We could have maybe possibly driven all the way to Jackson Hole in one day, but 13-14 hours of driving? Nah.</li>
 	<li>Day 2: On to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This is the home of Grand Teton National Park, and where our friends Eric and Shelley are living for a few months. We stayed with them for three nights.</li>
 	<li>Day 5: Left Jackson Hole and drove to Buffalo, Wyoming.</li>
 	<li>Day 6: Drove to Casper, Wyoming</li>
 	<li>Day 7: On to Cheyenne, the capitol of the state. Stayed three nights here.</li>
 	<li>Day 10: Back to Jackson Hole for a two night stay</li>
 	<li>Day 12: Left Jackson Hole, drove to Ontario, Oregon. Again, we could have driven all the way home, but why?</li>
 	<li>Day 13: Arrived back in Seattle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Total trip: 13 days, 3,317 miles, 63 hours of driving time.
<h2>Jackson Hole</h2>
Jackson Hole is the home of Grand Teton National Park. To say the Grand Teton mountains are spectacular would be quite the understatement. These things just jut straight up out of a valley.

[caption id="attachment_6373" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6373" rel="attachment wp-att-6373"><img class="wp-image-6373 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wyo-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a> The Grand Tetons, seen from just a few yards from our friends' condo.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6375" rel="attachment wp-att-6375"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6375" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09167-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a>Yeah, pretty nice, eh?

Grand Teton National Park was first signed into existence by President Calvin Coolidge in 1929. It was a much smaller park, protecting mostly the mountains. But John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife, Abby Aldridge, had visited the area in the late '20s and wanted to save much more of the valley from development. So he started buying land in the valley and talking to government officials about donating that land to be added to the park.

In 1942, frustrated by federal inaction on accepting his land as a gift and adding it to the park, Rockefeller told the Secretary of the Interior that he might sell the land to commercial interests. That concentrated minds in Washington, D.C. and President Roosevelt soon signed a bill creating a 220,000 acre national monument, administered by the National Park Service.

1950 saw the National Park and National Monument combined into the Grand Teton National Park, with some additional land thrown in. Now the Park is about 480 square miles and includes most of the valley and the mountains and some surrounding areas. John D. Rockefeller, Sr. may have been a robber baron, but his children surely did lots of good with the money he accumulated: Grand Teton National Park is to a large extent, a legacy of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife.
<h2>The Town of Jackson</h2>
We'd heard much about the town of Jackson, which is about 15 miles south of the park itself.  We drove through Jackson as we arrived and vowed to not return for a closer look. Faux-Western buildings, souvenir shops everywhere, chi-chi restaurants, art galleries etc., the whole place jammed with tourists. It seems that the town of Jackson has one purpose: extract dollars from the wallets of tourists. Not a place for us.
<h2>Chapel of the Transfiguration</h2>
How's this for wonderful place to get married? Eric and Shelley tied the knot here!
<h2><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6376" rel="attachment wp-att-6376"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6376" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09160-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a>
The Gros Ventre Slide</h2>
In 1925 a mountainside across the valley from the Grand Teton mountains broke loose and crashed into the valley below. Fifty million (!!) cubic yards of soil and rocks and trees slid into the valley, damming the river and sending a wave of dirt and rocks 300 feet up the opposite side of the canyon. We took a trail walk through the area and tried to imagine what that wall of destruction looked like.

[caption id="attachment_6378" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6378" rel="attachment wp-att-6378"><img class="wp-image-6378 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09193-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a> The bare spots on the mountain in the distance is where the Gros Ventre slide occurred.

This is one absolutely beautiful area - often breathtaking. <em>Always </em>breathtaking. We'll be back. We were, of course, spoiled by the wonderful hospitality of our hosts, Eric and Shelley. As an example of that hospitality, here's a picture of one meal:

[caption id="attachment_6387" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6387" rel="attachment wp-att-6387"><img class="size-large wp-image-6387" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09180-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a> The question is, of course; did we have waffles for dinner or champagne for breakfast? You choose. I might point out that on the waffle is a roasted-walnut/bourbon syrup; we ate well.[/caption]
<h2>From Jackson Hole to Buffalo</h2>
This is a drive from the northwestern corner of Wyoming to the center and then up to the northeastern part. You see a lot of sagebrush on this drive! But we also saw some pretty spectacular scenery.
<h3><strong>On the Togwotee Pass (pronounced "to-ga-dee"):</strong></h3>
[caption id="attachment_6390" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6390" rel="attachment wp-att-6390"><img class="wp-image-6390 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09346-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a> The pass tops out at 9,659 ft. The tops of this rock formation are about 11,500 ft. This is a high state![/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6391" rel="attachment wp-att-6391"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6391" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09235-1024x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="266" /></a>Some years ago, when I was doing consulting work in Wyoming, I passed this roadside sign. Wyoming has many markers showing the age of rocks seen from the road, but this one caught my eye. To my later regret, I didn't stop and pick up a rock.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6393" rel="attachment wp-att-6393"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6393" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09244-1024x548.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="343" /></a>

This is probably the oldest rock in the United States and, for some years, was in the running for the oldest in the world (no longer: a rock formation in Finland has been dated at 4.3 billion years old). Anyway, this time I stopped and now have a piece of granite gneiss three billion years old.

And here it is!

<h2>Oregon Trail Sightings</h2>
Laurie and I are "rut nuts;" that is, enthusiasts of the Oregon and California Trail. We know lots about it, and we have tried to find places where there are still visible traces of the trail. Since the trail went right through Wyoming, we knew we would be able to find some traces of it here.

Our first trail-seeking adventure on this ramble was a dirt road that goes southwest out of Casper. This road is there because the trail went through there 170 years ago, and was used by later inhabitants of the area. We drove for about three hours, saw exactly zero other vehicles or persons and looked for some trail tracks. At first I couldn't find any visible traces, and wondered if it wasn't actually in this area; it's not as if there are road signs to it.
<h3>Wall of Rocks</h3>
This geological feature was a landmark on the Oregon/California Trail. I'd read that it was on this road but had forgotten until I saw the actual thing, at which point I practically shouted, "The Wall of Rocks! The wagons went right by here." At least we knew we were on the right track.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6396" rel="attachment wp-att-6396"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6396" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09258-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6395" rel="attachment wp-att-6395"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6395" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09256-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a>
We stopped to walk around, because the emigrant wagon trains would have gone past the Wall of Rocks exactly where the road is. And there, we found a marker put up by the Oregon-California Trails Association (OCTA - we are OCTA members). The OCTA puts up markers where there are visible traces of the trail. As we slowly traveled farther on the dirt road, we found some 25-30 more OCTA markers and, sure enough, at each one, we could see some trace of the trail. Emigrants traveled this route from 1843 to the late 1850s, so these traces are at least 160 years old!

Unfortunately, what the eye can see often does not show up well in photographs. In the picture below is a line where the ground-covering is lighter - this is the path of wagons through this area. In the foreground we could see a "swale," a depression in the ground where the wagons traveled - this isn't visible in the photo. Rarely do you see actual ruts, because the wagons did not follow each other exactly; they would spread out some, forming that depression.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6397" rel="attachment wp-att-6397"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6397" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09260-1013x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="647" /></a>
I realize that a common reaction to my Oregon Trail ramblings is "meh," but we find it fascinating to see these traces of the trail. Think about selling much of what you own, packing the rest into a small wagon and setting off on a 2,500 mile, five-six month journey through inhospitable territory to a place about which you know nothing, hoping for the best. That's courageous!
<h2>The Guernsey Ruts</h2>
The Guernsey ruts are touted as the best and clearest ruts to be seen on the Oregon Trail. Here there is a path where the ruts are four feet deep! But as the Orange One would say, that's kind of Fake News. The wagons did pass through here, but those deep ruts were created later by commercial wagons carrying limestone. However, walking a ways off the main ruts, you come across this:

[caption id="attachment_6398" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6398" rel="attachment wp-att-6398"><img class="wp-image-6398 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09284-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a> Here you can clearly see the swale - the depression in the ground - created by the thousands of wagons that passed this way.[/caption]
<h2>Fort Laramie</h2>
Fort Laramie, near the eastern border of Wyoming, was a big deal for the emigrants: the first civilization they would see after leaving their "jump-off spot," (usually in Missouri). They would reach the fort after almost a month of traveling. The fort was established in the 1830s as a supply post for overland travelers (the Oregon/California migrations started in earnest in the early-1840s, but there was some travel starting the the early 1830s) and converted to an Army post in 1849.

After decommissioning in 1890, the fort fell into disrepair. Many of the buildings and furniture were sold at auction to residents of the area. In 1938, the fort became part of the National Park Service and began a long and slow restoration. Today about a dozen buildings have been restored inside and out. The buildings are furnished and look as if the occupants just got up and went out for a walk.

I asked a ranger where the park service had gotten all the furniture and clothes and fittings that reflect when the fort was active. He said that many pieces of furniture were returned to the fort by the descendants of families who had obtained them in that "going out of business" auction in 1890; many of the chairs and tables and beds and bookcases and so forth were actually used when Ft. Laramie was an active army fort.

This is the third time I've visited Fort Laramie, the first time for Laurie. Even though it was hot-hot-hot here, we very much enjoyed seeing it and will almost certainly return to it.
<h2>Casper</h2>
We stayed one night in Casper, the second largest city in Wyoming. Honestly, that's not saying much: Casper's population is about 57,000 folks, while Cheyenne - number 1 in Wyoming - is about 64,000. These two cities account for 21% of Wyoming's population. But size is in the eye of the beholder: when I worked in Wyoming I asked a woman who had just moved to Cheyenne from Lander (pop: 7,500) how she liked Cheyenne. She responded, "Oh, I love it! I've never lived in a big city before."

The adventure in Casper was the drive on a dirt road that covered the Oregon trail (see above). Casper is a nice city, but we just kind of hung out after that drive, and left the next morning.
<h2>From Casper to Cheyenne</h2>
From Casper we went to Cheyenne, in the southeastern corner of Wyoming. Cheyenne is about a three hour drive from Casper, but we took one really nice detour. As we were headed down the freeway (at 80 mph and being passed constantly), we saw a sign for a road to a natural arch. Well, we'd never seen such a thing and we were on no schedule, so off we went. We found a beautiful county park with, indeed, a natural arch across LePrele river.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6413" rel="attachment wp-att-6413"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6413" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09274-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6414" rel="attachment wp-att-6414"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6414" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09276-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a>
When we get back next to Wyoming, we're getting up a picnic lunch and coming to this park - Ayres Natural Arch Bridge Park - and spending some time here. It was an oasis of calm and beauty.

We also stopped at the Guernsey Ruts and Fort Laramie on this leg.
<h2>Cheyenne</h2>
When I was doing consulting work here in the mid-2000s, I came to Cheyenne for three days almost every week for two years, so I know Cheyenne. I also know that Cheyenne is not a tourist draw; honestly, there isn't much to bring tourists here. But I like Cheyenne a lot, maybe because of that lack of touristy things to do.

One thing Cheyenne has, like the rest of Wyoming, is great steaks. The first night we ate at my favorite Cheyenne restaurant, the Albany. I don't know how to describe the Albany, other than to say I'm not sure it's changed much since it opened in 1942. It's small - you might be able to squeeze 80 people in there, and in these times, the limit was closer to 40 folks. (As a side note, we found that Wyoming was pretty conscientious about following coronavirus guidelines: we saw few un-masked folks, and restaurants and stores were observing distancing guidelines, throughout the state. Our one stop in Montana was different: <em>nobody</em> was masked or distancing, even in restaurants.)

Here's what we had:<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6420" rel="attachment wp-att-6420"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6420" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wyo-4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a>

That's about 12-14 ounces of <em>really </em>good prime rib, done perfectly, with a baked potato. Price: $14.99. $14.99! That's gotta be a $30 slab of meat in Seattle. We went back to the Albany the next night for the same meal.

For breakfast, we had to go to the Luxury Diner. Unless a person knew something about the Luxury, he or she would drive right on past, never thinking about actually eating there. Mistake! The Luxury is an institution for a reason.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6418" rel="attachment wp-att-6418"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6418" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/luxury2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="499" /></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6417" rel="attachment wp-att-6417"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6417 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luxury.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="473" /></a>

I apologize that I didn't take any food pictures here, but I can tell you:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Laurie's 2x2x2 breakfast (two pancakes, two eggs and two sausage patties) was $10;</li>
 	<li>The next day, Laurie's Senior Special (three pancakes, an egg and sausage) was $5;</li>
 	<li>My hashbrowns, toast, and corned beef hash was $10;</li>
 	<li>All of it was excellent. Honestly, we believe the pancakes were the best we've ever had. They were fabulous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
I used to have lunch here, too, and the lunches were top-notch. Love this place.
<h2>The Ames Monument</h2>
A friend asked me if we were going to see the Ames Monument, outside Cheyenne (trying, I think, to come up with something so oddball that I'd have to admit that, no, we weren't going to see that). I surprised him by saying that I'd already seen it and of course we'd go there. And we did.

This was part of some off-the-main-roads traveling we did outside Cheyenne. After driving on a dirt road for an hour or so, we came to the Ames Monument which, fortunately, is about ten minutes from the freeway so we didn't have to drive back on that dirt road. Who were the Ames brothers and why is there a monument to them here?<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6424" rel="attachment wp-att-6424"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6424 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC09333.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="800" /></a>
Oakes Ames and Oliver Ames were instrumental in financing the Union Pacific railroad, the eastern part of the first transcontinental railroad. When other financing failed, they took over and got Congress to provide financing, taking for themselves a rather comfortable chunk for their efforts, of course. It turned out later that their efforts to "persuade" members of Congress to approve the financing was often accompanied by some payments made under the table to those Congressmen.

In the 1870s the Union Pacific, trying to rehabilitate the Ames Brothers' reputation (and the company's at the same time) built the Ames Monument. At the time it was at the highest point on the transatlantic railroad, and trains actually stopped to let passengers see the monument. A later change to the railroad's route now means the monument is out in the middle of nowhere. We'd never make a special trip to see it - and would not recommend doing so to any traveller - but as part of a day-trip, it was fun to see.
<h2>A Trip Highlight: Re-connecting with Friends</h2>
When I worked in Wyoming, a colleague told me she wanted to introduce me to Steve L., saying she thought we'd become friends. We did! Steve and I met for lunch or coffee often, and I got to know his wife, Carol, and kids, too. But it had been some time since we'd connected and so I emailed him that we'd be in Cheyenne for a few days. The result: we got together with Steve and Carol and their younger daughter for an evening and had just the best time. It was as if no time had passed, except time had passed and there was lots to catch up on. We talked for four hours and could have continued longer. That evening was a highlight of our Wyoming ramble; so nice to re-connect with friends.
<h2>Heading Home</h2>
After Cheyenne we went back to Jackson Hole to spend another couple days with Shelley and Eric, then home to Seattle. On the way we stopped at one interesting place: Craters of the Moon in central Idaho.

Central Idaho doesn't have much in the way of scenery, but Craters of the Moon is amazing. Somewhere around 12,000 years ago, lava started to flow in this area, covering over 600 square miles. The formations are nothing short of amazing.

After Craters of the Moon, it was back to Seattle for us (with an overnight in Ontario, Oregon). Our 13-day Wyopalooza Ramble was done. We had a <i>great</i> time! We think Wyoming may be the most under-rated state in the country. Yes, it has miles and miles of nothing but miles and miles (with sagebrush), but it also has some just spectacular scenery, and some interesting history, especially for us Oregon Trail buffs. We're looking forward to getting back to the Cowboy State.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, believe it or else, we are back in the traveling mode. We arrived in France last Sunday, after reasonably pleasant flights on Delta Airlines - St. Louis to Atlanta and then Atlanta to Paris. Picked up a car, drove to Mary and Gilles for a quick visit with their family, then to our French "home away from home." Very nice to be back!

We decided to give this a go when, a few months ago, we read that France and other European countries were considering opening up to vaccinated travelers. We knew that might not happen, but airlines were allowing cost-free changes so we figured we didn't have anything to lose; if France didn't open up, we'd just re-schedule to next year. In the event, France did open up to vaccinated travelers, ended some pretty draconian quarantine measures, and said, "C'mon over." So we are!

First, a quick update: five days in St. Louis!
<h2>St. Louis</h2>
This is our first time in St. Louis and, we think, first time in Missouri, which is commonly pronounced "Missoura" and even more commonly pronounced "Misery." Currently second-lowest of all states in vaccination rates, it has one of the highest COVID infection rates in the country. St. Louis just reintroduced a mask mandate for all indoor places and public transportation, which the county council immediately voted to overturn, to cheering and applause in the council chambers. Idiots.

Craig and Annie and the grandkids moved here in early July because Annie has taken a position with a biotech company that has labs here and works with the university. She is totally excited about her new company and the many new things she's going to learn there. Craig likes having a house that doesn't require major repairs all the time.

They live in a lovely area of Kirkwood, a suburb of St. Louis proper. Their street is lined with beautiful old trees, and the houses are a mix of older ones built in the 1950s, and newer ones that have replaced older ones. All very nicely done, so the neighborhood has a nice feel. There is an excellent downtown area within easy walking distance, with lots of good restaurants and shops and a seven-day-a-week farmers' market. All very nice; Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry are happy to be there.

Moves are, of course, not ever trouble-free, and this one was no exception. Due to be delivered about July 2nd or 3rd, the furniture and household goods arrived the day after we arrived, July 26. So we got put to work; my job was to take the empty boxes to the garage, pull out all the paper packing and break the boxes down flat. I ended up with a <em>lot</em> of paper, and Henry and Clara had some fun with it. Here's a picture of Henry being thrown into the pile; he <em>loved</em> it!

[caption id="attachment_6544" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6544" rel="attachment wp-att-6544"><img class="size-full wp-image-6544" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00064-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="764" /></a> Henry in the air[/caption]

And here's the new abode. Quite a change from their Elmsford house, which was about 40% the size and 60 years older!

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6546" rel="attachment wp-att-6546"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6546" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00070.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1002" /></a>

Last Sunday we said goodbye - for now - to St. Louis and headed to the airport. Honestly, for the first time in a long time, I was a little anxious about this: first international trip since COVID so we didn't know the process, new airline (Delta - hadn't ever flown Delta internationally), new airport, didn't know how we were going to contact the car place in France to have them come to pick us up. Of course, it all worked out fine: the Delta agent in St. Louis was an absolute delight, checked vaccination records and other necessary forms, didn't weigh our bags (always a worry because 3 months of clothes put us near the 51 lb limit on all three bags), "forgot" to charge us for our extra suitcase, then both of us got TSA Pre-check (Laurie has had some problems with this even though we have Global Entry), so security took a full three minutes or so.

Now, arrival at Charles De Gaulle (still called its old name of Roissy by every French person) was a little less fun. Thirty-five minutes to go through passport control - and when we got in line, it looked as if it was going to be much longer than that, and a bit of a hassle getting someone to call the car place. Remember, our phones don't work in France until we put our French SIMs in them, and the SIMs were at Mary and Gilles' house, so we couldn't just dial the place. But a wonderful lady at the Air France baggage services called them, told them we were there and that they needed to send a car. <em>Merci beaucoup, Madam!</em>

Got the car, drove to Mary &amp; Gilles for a quick visit, went to our cottage, where Penny and Pierre (our hosts but much more importantly, great friends) had us and Mary and Gilles over for champagne and cheese and birthday cake for Mary. We could not have had a better welcome back to France.

In case you're wondering, we're in Bois-le-Roi, a town of about 6,000 folks, 50 km or so south of Paris. Real Soon Now, I'll post pictures so you can see it. In the meantime, here's our French "home-away-from-home," where we'll reside for two and a half months, except for a few rambles we have planned:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6545" rel="attachment wp-att-6545"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6545" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00111-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /></a>

We're here! We are very happy to be here! Four bottles of champagne down, many to go.

P.S. Started the 2021 <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?page_id=779">cheese log</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Thursday we took a day trip to the Sancerre region, for two reasons: to buy some Sancerre wine from a winery that we've visited and bought from since we started our long stays here, and to have lunch with friends who have a second house near Sancerre and were staying there. This was our first ramble of this trip and it was a good one.

Sancerre is about an hour and a half south, an easy day trip. We went with Mary and Gilles, who put their lives in my hands and asked me to drive. It's really a lovely drive through rural France.

Sancerre produces a red wine and a rosé, but it's famous for its white wine, made from the sauvignon blanc grape. The soil in Sancerre is flinty and the wine takes on some of that characteristic: very dry and with a touch of mineral taste. We've heard several people who don't like that and who have said they had drunk Sancerre whites that had a "cat piss" flavor. (They are always quick to point out they've never actually drunk cat piss...) Maybe so, but we haven't run into that at all. Sancerre is our favorite white wine in the world.

There are a few grapes grown here:

[caption id="attachment_6572" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6572" rel="attachment wp-att-6572"><img class="size-full wp-image-6572" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00116.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /></a> Lots o' grapes[/caption]

We bought our wine at the winery, in a small town with maybe a hundred people and ten or fifteen wineries. I might point out that, as in many French wineries, the "tasting room" is a counter in the warehouse with the equipment that corks and labels the bottles and stores the finished product. No tasting charge, no ball caps for sale, just "Have a taste and buy what you want." We did just that.

I should point out that only three of these cartons (six bottles per) were for us.[/caption]

Sancerre, as with the rest of France, suffered badly this year from the worst weather in decades. A killing frost early in the season, hail storms and then way too much rain (it still is raining here, in August, when the grapes need constant sunshine). The winemaker here said they usually get 12-15 clumps of grapes from each plant and this year it will be one clump per plant, and that clump will be of low quality. Really, it's been a disastrous year, here in Sancerre and in almost all wine-producing regions of France.

Then it was off to the town of Sancerre for lunch. Now, Sancerre the town exists for one thing: people coming to the area to taste and buy Sancerre wine. The town sits on top of a hill, affording a beautiful view of the area. Sancerre itself is a nice walking town, and has spruced up a bit recently.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6581" rel="attachment wp-att-6581"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6581" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00122.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6582" rel="attachment wp-att-6582"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6582" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00130.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="504" /></a>

There are also some excellent restaurants here and Mary had reserved at one that turned out to be a great choice. On the menu were ten or twelve <em>planches: </em>platters; each featuring food from a different area. Almost all of us chose the platter of the south-west, a region in France famous for duck being served at every meal and most between-meal snacks. We could not believe how much duck was on that platter: a brochette with four large pieces, and about half a roast duck. It was just great; we walked out waddling and quacking.

We also had a wonderful visit with our friends Yves and Valerie, who met us at the restaurant. Over the years here we've gathered what we call our "French family," and this first week, back for the first time in over three years, we have totally enjoyed re-uniting with that family. Here's part of that family:

We headed back to Bois-le-Roi after a quick stop to buy the local cheese. This is called "<em>Crottin de Chauvignol</em>", <em>crottin </em>being the French word for sheep droppings. That's right; it's so named because this cheese comes in a form that looks, well, like sheep droppings. Here is what we bought:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6587" rel="attachment wp-att-6587"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6587" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00134.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="265" /></a>

These are arranged by age; the youngest on the left, the oldest is on the right in the picture. As <em>Crottin de Chauvignol</em> ages, it get a bit smaller and drier and the flavor intensifies. We like them all, and in this case we bought one <em>crottin</em> of each age they were selling, but if I'm buying just a couple in a cheese store I get the oldest available.

After a stop at the cheese store, it was back to home base. A very nice day, indeed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week we came to Paris for three days. Now any halfway-regular reader of this blog knows that we love Paris. We think it is the best city in the world, a qualification that may not be exactly valid because we haven't visited every city in the world, so how would we really know? Details, details, details!

This trip Paris definitely has a different feel than it has in the past, and we ascribe that to a couple reasons:

First, this is the first time in years that we have been in Paris in August. In August (and to a lesser extent, July) much of France goes on vacation and this means that many stores and restaurants here are closed for three or four weeks in August. It also means that with a few exceptions - the two main tourist areas of the Louvre museum and around the Eiffel Tower - the number of people on the street is way less than usual. So the city doesn't have the buzz that we've come to know.

Second, we noted in places that the feel was kind of somber. We saw this most clearly in the area around Notre Dame, where there is usually a huge crowd of people laughing and gawking and taking selfies and just having a grand time in the presence of the grand old lady. This time there were way fewer people and they were quiet, in awe of what happened to Notre Dame two years ago, at how close it came to completely collapsing, and at how much work is being done to restore it. (I'll post some pictures below.)

Then France has been through a tough time since that fire two years ago. The fire shocked the nation, which watched live as one of the emotional centers of the country burned almost to destruction. Ten months later, France was hit hard by COVID and had to literally shut down for several months. The country has recovered to a large extent but now has been hit again with the Delta variant. So I guess it's not unexpected that Paris would feel quieter and a bit somber in places.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Notre Dame</h2>
On the evening of April 18, 2019, an alarm indicated a fire in the attic of Notre Dame. An inspector was sent to check, but given the wrong location. Fifteen minutes later, inspectors got to the right place and found the fire developing rapidly. The fire department was finally called and arrived about 40 minutes after that first alarm, at which time flames were not yet visible outside, but the amount of smoke indicated that the fire had spread through thousand-year-old wooden supports under the cathedral's lead roof. From this point on, it was a race to get the fire under control before the roof, and inevitably the rest of the cathedral, collapsed. Ile de la Cité was evacuated, and thousands gathered to watch with horror as the Cathedral, built in the twelfth century, fought for her life.

By early the next morning, the fire was pretty much out. Two areas of the roof had collapsed completely, and there was structural damage to much of the east end of the structure, but the damage was far less than it could have been. Notre Dame stood and today is in the midst of an amazing reconstruction. Estimates are that it will be open for the 2024 Paris Olympic games, though a full reconstruction will take some twenty years.

Notice the wood frames in the flying buttresses to support them. Without the weight of the lead roof, these are in danger of collapsing.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6612" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6612" rel="attachment wp-att-6612"><img class="size-full wp-image-6612" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4419.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a> Much of the structure is wrapped in scaffolding.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6611" align="aligncenter" width="417"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6611" rel="attachment wp-att-6611"><img class="size-full wp-image-6611" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4416.jpg" alt="" width="417" height="600" /></a> And yet, the Grand Old Lady of Paris still looks pretty grand; a beautiful site to see standing. The bell tower on the left, containing the nine huge bells of the cathedral, came within a hair of collapsing, which would have brought the entire cathedral down.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">A Couple Food Notes</h2>
I didn't take pictures of all our meals in Paris, though we had some good ones. There is a typical Paris bistro just a few minutes walk from Mary &amp; Gilles' flat, where we stay, and we enjoyed eating there a couple times. But I did discover something new. Our favorite breakfast treat is not, as many imagine, a croissant (though we do love them), but a <em>pan aux raisin</em>. But one morning I got to the <em>boulangerie</em> late and...<em>quelle horror!</em> <em>pas de pan aux raisin</em>. So I tried this: a <em>pan suisse</em>. I didn't even know what those dark dots were, but it looked kinda sorta like a <em>pan aux raisin</em>.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6613" rel="attachment wp-att-6613"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6613" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4408.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="374" /></a>Well, those dark dots are chocolate chips. Pretty dang good, but <em>pan aux raisin</em> remains our favorite. Next morning I was at the <em>boulangerie</em> nice and early.

We also visited a favorite small restaurant: Salon Med on Ile St. Louis. Officially a "Salon de Thé" (Tea Salon) it's really a restaurant; we don't know why it's called a tea salon - though I suppose you could get a cup of tea there - but I suspect it has something to do with French bureaucracy, which can be crazy about restaurants. Anyway, Salon Med serves pasta and crepes and we have always chosen the same things from the crepes menu: first, a "scandinave" gallette, which is havarti cheese, smoked salmon and a barely fried egg. Then, for dessert, a <em>chocolate amandes</em> (almonds) crepe: pictured below. Good? <em>Bien sûr</em>! That's why we have it every time! We think the first time we ate here was in 1993 and you know what we had? Yep, same as on this visit.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6615" rel="attachment wp-att-6615"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6615" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4422.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="451" /></a>
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Musée des Arts Décoratif</h2>
For whatever reason, Laurie and I have come to enjoy seeing how people lived in times past - what their rooms and houses and chateaux and castles looked like and what they contained in terms of furniture and decor. That describes Decorative Arts, so we were looking forward to seeing this museum.

It was great. It was also a little overwhelming in scope - lots and lots of stuff, from the 16th century to (some) modern stuff. Remember, though, seldom do you see a presentation or museum of decorative arts that shows what the everyday Joe and Joan had in  their house; what you see is what aristocrats and monarchs had. So it is with the Musée des Arts Décoratif. Laurie described it best as "over the top."
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Clocks</h2>
I like old fancy clocks; here are a few of the many in the museum. I'd be proud to have any or all of these in our house. Laurie is not so sure...<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6624" rel="attachment wp-att-6624">

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Other Interesting(?) Things</h2>
[caption id="attachment_6628" align="aligncenter" width="549"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6628" rel="attachment wp-att-6628"><img class="size-full wp-image-6628" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00167.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="600" /></a> How about a real, authentic "he-really-sat-in-it" Napoleon throne?[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6627" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6627" rel="attachment wp-att-6627"><img class="size-full wp-image-6627" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00163.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a> What living room wouldn't be improved by this, um, couch?[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6625" align="aligncenter" width="399"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6625" rel="attachment wp-att-6625"><img class="size-full wp-image-6625" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00157.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="600" /></a> Or this beautiful chair?[/caption]

And think of the lovely restful sleep you could get in this bed...

[caption id="attachment_6623" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6623" rel="attachment wp-att-6623"><img class="size-full wp-image-6623" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00154.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a> Not sure about the "restful sleep" part; this bed was in a display of furniture from courtesans' homes...[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Hotel Lambert, on Ile St. Louis</h2>
Ile st. Louis, where we used to stay before our long-stay visits to France, is smack in the middle of the Seine river, and home to some of the priciest real estate in Paris. The picture below is of Hôtel Lambert, one of the most beautiful houses on the island (In French, "hôtel" refers not just to the normal interpretation, but also to huge and beautiful private homes.).

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6617" rel="attachment wp-att-6617"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6617" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4448.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="600" /></a>

In 2007 the brother of the Emir of Qatar bought Hotel Lambert for about $111 million and believe it or not, that was for a fixer-upper! He had great plans for it, including a full restoration. After some to-ing and fro-ing with authorities about what he could and couldn't do with this historic building, work commenced.

In 2013, the work was almost done. One day that summer we were walking along the quai on which Hotel Lambert faces and saw a lot of fire trucks and police trucks  standing around and some smoke coming out of the roof. Turns out that the night before, after a $65 million restoration, a large section burned. No big deal, though: three years and another $19 million and all is fixed up.

Can anyone get inside to see this beautiful work, after all that reconstruction and repair? Not a chance, unless you know the Emir if Qatar. But it is a beautiful and historic building to see.

That's a quick look at our first visit to Paris in three years. The city still entrances us and even with some small obstacles (I wrenched my back the second morning so was hurtin' some as we walked, and it got hot: 85!) we loved being back in the City of Light and look forward to getting back.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6662" rel="attachment wp-att-6662"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6662" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00273.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399"></a>Our friends Jamie and Hervé have sung the praises of Montreuil-sur-Mer since they visited the town several years ago (Hervé is from a small town not far away) and when they suggested we meet them there for a couple days, we thought about it for at least five seconds and signed up. We are super-glad we did: we had a great time with Jamie and Hervé and Montreuil-sur-Mer is probably the most beautiful and interesting small town we've ever seen in France - or anywhere for that matter.

Now first, how is the town's name pronounced? Well, us native English speakers will likely&nbsp;<em>never</em> get it right, as <em>euil&nbsp;</em>is one of the most difficult syllables for us to pronounce. The best I can say is "mon-troy" with the "oy" close to that in "oy-veh!" That's as good as I can describe it.

The name means, of course, "Montreuil by the Sea" which is surprising because the Atlantic is about 10 miles away. But in the 13th century, an inlet of the ocean, large enough for navy ships, reached Montreuil-sur-Mer; it was the only Atlantic seaport controlled by the French monarchy; since then, the inlet has silted up and a person standing at the highest point of Montreuil-sur-Mer can just barely maybe possibly see the ocean.

Montreuil-sur-Mer is a small town, about 2,900 people, a bit south of Calais (you can see it on Google Earth at <a class="external text" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Montreuil,_Pas-de-Calais&amp;params=50.4648_N_1.763_E_type:city(1952)_region:FR-HDF"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">50°27′53″N</span> <span class="longitude">1°45′47″E).</span></span></span></a> It is a completely walled town. It has a part in history: in 1066 William the Conquerer gathered his army and navy here, sailed to England, won the Battle of Hastings and became the first Norman king of England. During World War I the Allied Headquarters were here from 1916 to 1919, when they were closed after the war's end in November, 1918.

Montreuil-sur-Mer has another attraction for me: one of my favorite books is Victor Hugo's <em>Les Miserables</em>, and in that book the main character, Jean Valjean, lived here for six years and became mayor of the town. Fantine, mother of Cosette, also lived and died here. For me then, I looked forward to walking the streets that Jean Valjean walked (really, the streets that Victor Hugo walked, as he placed that part of <em>L</em><em>es Miserables</em> here after spending several long vacations in the town).

Rather than write a long and boring description of Montreuil-sur-Mer (ignoring that I just wrote a long and boring description above), I'll give you some pictures...

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">The Walls and Citadelle</h2>
Montreuil-our-Mer is a completely walled city. We walked every inch of the walls, which are 80-100 feet high in many places. We also visited the Citadelle, which was the center of the city's defenses for hundreds of years.

[caption id="attachment_6748" align="aligncenter" width="325"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6748" rel="attachment wp-att-6748"><img class="wp-image-6748" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00233.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="488"></a> The earliest structure in the city's defenses, this arch was constructed in the 1260s(!)[/caption]

I've always wondered what the soldiers of an attacking army thought when they saw a city with tall, strongly-defended walls like Monteuil's and heard their officers say, "Ok, men, climb up those walls and take the town! We'll be right behind you."[/caption]

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Food</h2>
We ate well here. Hoo-hah, did we eat well here. I'm not a fan of food photos, so only a couple here, and pictures of the restaurants at which we had dinner.

[caption id="attachment_6759" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6759" rel="attachment wp-att-6759"><img class="size-full wp-image-6759" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00390.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="497"></a> Had dinner here the first night. We agreed that it was among the best dinners we've <em>ever</em> had in France. This restaurant is in a former house which was built in 1537![/caption]

Main course was&nbsp;<em>maigré,</em> a white fish, for all but me. I had a&nbsp;<em>tangine d'agneau&nbsp;</em>(lamb tangine). Then we had dessert...yes, we did:

[caption id="attachment_6761" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6761" rel="attachment wp-att-6761"><img class="wp-image-6761 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0649-2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="312"></a> <em>Profiteroles</em>, an old French dessert that many restaurants still serve. But rarely like these, which were fantastic. They were listed on the menu as <em>Les Authentiques Profiteroles</em>. Don't know exactly what that meant, as we've never had&nbsp;<em>faux profiteroles,</em> but, geeze, were they good.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6760" align="aligncenter" width="504"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6760" rel="attachment wp-att-6760"><img class="wp-image-6760 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_0648-2.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="600"></a> Laurie had this dessert, which she describes as a rhubarb mousse. It, too, was amazing.[/caption]

Lunch the next day:

[caption id="attachment_6762" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6762" rel="attachment wp-att-6762"><img class="wp-image-6762 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4505.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a> Frites, Welsh, salad and beef stew. Post-lunch nap required.[/caption]

The next night we downscaled a bit to this restaurant. It served what I describe as "hot pots." We all had the fish one, which included mussels, cod, shrimp, veggies and potatos in a pretty tasty broth. Not so fancy as the night before (and about half the cost), but very good.<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6758" rel="attachment wp-att-6758"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6758" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00372.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">One More Thing: a Monastery</h2>
We took a tour of a Carthusian monastery (no longer active) nearby. We really like visiting monasteries and convents and abbeys. Always interesting places, always with histories attached, and always insights into a life long gone.

This monastery had several interesting aspects. At any given time, there were only 24 monks and 24 brothers. The monks ran the place, had religious instruction and duties and lived in reasonably nice quarters; each monk had a small two story cottage with a garden (they could raise anything they wanted in the garden, except food). The brothers were essentially peasants from the area and did not live in such nice quarters; they did the hard work of the monastery.

This monastery served as the printer for all Carthusian monasteries in Europe; this increased its wealth immeasurably, and gave it power, as it decided what books would be printed and sent to other monasteries.

[caption id="attachment_6764" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6764" rel="attachment wp-att-6764"><img class="size-full wp-image-6764" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00289.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="418"></a> The chapel of the monastery.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6765" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6765" rel="attachment wp-att-6765"><img class="size-full wp-image-6765" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00291.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> The cloister, unusual in that the walls were enclosed in glass.This was because the weather was pretty bad and to be able to use the cloister, it had to be enclosed. We've been to a lot of cloisters, and never seen that.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6766" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6766" rel="attachment wp-att-6766"><img class="wp-image-6766 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC00294.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> For Laurie's library friends... This room was off the main library and called the Purgatory Room. Here newly arrived books were kept until the head monk could review them and see if they were acceptable, in terms of dogma, for other Carthusian monasteries to use. Clearly, this gave the monastery huge power.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6784" align="aligncenter" width="450"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6784" rel="attachment wp-att-6784"><img class="wp-image-6784 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4501.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a> And for Laurie's gardener friends.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6783" rel="attachment wp-att-6783"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6783" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_4499.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a>

Montreuil-sur-Mer was a huge hit with us. We walked and walked and climbed stairs and climbed more stairs and still we didn't see everything. We've found over the years that maybe the greatest pleasure in traveling is just walking around places like Montreuil-sur-Mer and absorbing the beauty and culture and history. I suspect we will return to this town.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we first came to France for a long-stay vacation, we lived in the small town of Montigny-sur-Loing ("Montigny on the Loing River"). As I researched places around Montigny I came across Moret-sur-Loing, about 10 miles away, and found that Alfred Sisley, one of our long-time Impressionist favorites, lived in Moret for many years, died there and is buried in the Moret-sur-Loing cemetery. He painted many pictures while he lived in Moret, and other Impressionists came to visit and paint with him; this town is well-known in the world of Impressionism. I knew Moret merited a visit; I did not foresee that it would become a favorite place of ours.

The Loing River flows through Moret and creates an idyllic riverside area. Moret was founded because of the river; a number of water mills were built here, for tanning and grain-milling. Several of those mills remain, and several have been replaced by more modern structures; the Germans destroyed the bridge across the river and a couple of the mills as they retreated during World War II.

The town also gets a point in the "Napoleon slept here" sweepstakes. When, in 1815, Napoleon returned from his first exile in Elba, he did, indeed, spend a night here. In fact, the "Hundred Days" that is used to describe his last hurrah in France, started in Moret-sur-Loing that night, and ended, one hundred days later, at Waterloo.

The water level was about 15 feet higher than you see it in this picture. Because it wasn't the first time the river had flooded, the town is built above the flood line and little damage was incurred. But it was amazing to see the river then.[/caption]

Moret-sur-Loing is just about our favorite place on a nice day when we don't have anything planned and just want to spend some time in a nice town. We love to walk along the river. Yesterday we bought sandwiches and tarts in town and sat on a bench for lunch, watching the river and the people. Nice way to spend a morning...]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Alsace Road Trip - Strasbourg]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1  style="font-family: verdana;">Alsace</h1>
We've been on a road trip to Alsace, in eastern France, for the last week and a half. We visited Strasbourg, Colmar and Mulhouse (pronounced "ma-looze," of course). We've never been to this part of France and Mary has suggested it for a road trip over the last few years. We finally got it together and are very glad we did; this is a very enjoyable, and very different, part of France.

First, the different. Alsace is located due east of Paris, a five hour drive, so about 280 miles. Over its history, it has bounced back and forth between France and Germany, the transition from one to the other almost always driven by hostilities. I thought about outlining the history of Alsace but the more I read, the more complicated it became. So I'm going to boil it down t0 answer the question, "Is Alsace French or German?" reminding you that there was no real Germany until the 1870s, Alsace has been:

French, then Germanic, then French with Germanic language, laws and customs prevailing, then French with French laws, then Prussian and Austrian (Germanic), then French, then German, and now French. Simple, eh?

The important thing to remember, and you'll see this in the houses and buildings of Alsace, is that the Germanic influence is stronger than the French influence here. Makes for an interesting area...

We were gone nine days and rather than post one big long boring post about the whole trip, I'll do several posts to cover each of the main places - Strasbourg, Colmar and Mulhouse - and maybe a couple shorter posts about places we visited. Let's start with some pictures of downtown Strasbourg. It will definitely make you think you're in a city smack in the middle of Germany.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Strasbourg</h2>
Strasbourg is a big city: about 470,000 people in the city proper and 800,000 in the "urban area" (including suburbs and smaller towns around the city). The central city is on an island of sorts; the Ill river splits north of the city, half goes in a stream to the east and the other half in a stream to the west, and rejoins south of the city.&nbsp;
<h3 style="font-family: verdana;">The Cathedral</h3>
The Strasbourg cathedral has several distinctive aspects. Like many churches in Europe, it was built on top of an earlier church, which may have been Catholic or Protestant or pagan. That church was started in the 1100s, largely of Romanesque architecture, solid, with thick walls, small windows and rounded or slightly pointed arches. In the 1200s, as the beautiful Gothic cathedrals were being built in France, work on the Romanesque Strasbourg cathedral was stopped and a Gothic design created. (This was not unusual; many churches in France and Europe had mysterious fires that burned a Romanesque church and allowed a new Gothic structure to be built in its place.) Rather than tearing down the existing Romanesque church, which had a completed apse and altar and transept, the new Gothic design was added onto it; this included the nave and almost all the exterior

The most unusual aspect of the Strasbourg cathedral is its west façade - the main entry to the cathedral and the most visible part. It has Gothic unlike any other we've seen.

[caption id="attachment_6837" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6837" rel="attachment wp-att-6837"><img class="size-full wp-image-6837" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00646-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> The Strasbourg Cathedral from the&nbsp;<em>place</em> in front of it. Where most Cathedrals have a façade decorated with statues and a rose window, this cathedral has statues, a rose window and many vertical columns holding arches. This gives the façade a vertical aspect unlike any other cathedral we've seen.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6833" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00584.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6833" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00584.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> A straight-on view of the façade, showing the vertical columns and arches that cover the west front.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6839" align="aligncenter" width="325"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00666-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6839" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00666-1.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="600"></a> This is pure Gothic architecture right up to the central arch over the alter. Beyond that, it's Romanesque, a reminder that the Cathedral was being built in Romanesque when Gothic started to appear in France (in the 1100s and 1200s). As Gothic gained in importance, many older churches were converted from Romanesque and often, as in the case of the Strasbourg Cathedral, the new Gothic sections were built on and alongside older Romanesque parts.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6835" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00618.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6835" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00618.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The bishop who preached here when the pulpit was carved had a dog of which he was particularly fond. He wanted to have the dog near him when he preached, and the person who carved the pulpit obliged him.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6838" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00661.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6838" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00661.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> What's a Cathedral without a beautiful organ? This one is particularly stunning. Built in the 1500s, so a "recent" addition to the Cathedral.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6841" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00613.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6841" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00613.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> This rose window has a funny story. It was originally designed to be much higher on the west front wall, but the person designing the building put the arch above it lower, which would have hidden the top third of the window. It was easier to lower the rose window than raise the arch so now it sits lower than rose windows in other cathedrals.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Walking Around</h2>
We did a LOT of walking in Strasbourg. It's a fairly compact city, with interesting things to see just about everywhere.&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_6849" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00590.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6849" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00590.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> This is the oldest "house" in Strasbourg, built in 1537! It's on the <em>place</em> in front of the Cathedral. The two bottom floors house a restaurant, at which we had a terrific dinner.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_6855" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00608.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6855" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00608.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> Another building on the Cathedral <em>place.</em>[/caption]
<h3 style="font-family: verdana;">Some Older Buildings</h3>

Really. It started life as a residence, and was donated to the city when its owner died. Nice school, eh?[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">The River Ill</h2>
Strasbourg's central area is surrounded by the river Ill. It's not a huge river, but the city has taken advantage of it fully, with miles of beautiful river banks and walks. We even took a boat that went all around the city, through a couple locks and up the Ill a few miles to see the European Parliament buildings.

Looked nice, on a lovely little <em>place</em>, nice staff, good menu. Our dinner there? Not so good. Maybe we should have gone to the Waffle Factory.[/caption]

That's my quick description of Strasbourg. We really liked it here and we know we saw a small part of its history and beauty. I suspect we will return on a future France trip. It's an easy high-speed train ride from Paris, and there really is no need for a car once you're here. But after three nights, it was time to head south to our next destination: Colmar.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Colmar was next up on our itinerary. It's not far from Strasbourg, smaller by quite a bit (around 75,000 compared to Strasbourg's 470,000) and definitely oriented more toward tourism. The city has many beautiful and interesting buildings, built in the half-timbered style common in much of Germany, and an excellent museum. It's also got a lot of tourists. We also used our stay here to visit the town of Riquewihr - a lovely small town in the mountains that is definitely oriented to tourism and not much else.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Sights Seen Walking Around Colmar</h2>
Lots of beautiful old buildings line the streets of Colmar. I might point out that many of these pictures were taken early in the morning; hence, not many people in the streets. Later in the day, Colmar lived up to its reputation as a tourist destination.

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Musée Unterlinden</h2>
This museum is the crown of Colmar's cultural scene. It contains quite a number of religious art works, including an altar triptych that is quite famous. Now I have to say that religious art is not my favorite genre, so I wasn't exactly deeply interested in much of this, but one aspect did catch my interest - polychrome wood carvings and statues.&nbsp;

But first - the cloister. Laurie and I have become fans of cloisters and try to visit nearby ones as we travel. Cloisters were places of walking mediations in convents and monasteries and it seems to us that they maintain that sense of peace and tranquility to this day. Musée Unterlinden is housed in a former convent and many of the rooms are located off this cloister. We walked around it several times, then found a couple chairs to sit in and enjoy the sun for a while.

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Wood Carvings from the Renaissance (1500s)</h2>
The museum has a number of religious statues carved of wood, with their original paint. These are from the 1500s generally and yet they look as if they were done recently. I really liked these. The beauty of these carvings and their color really caught my attention.

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">One more interesting exhibit...</h2>
There was a room titled "Cave Alsacienne" which I had to check out, of course...

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Doors and Windows</h2>
I guess some folks still like seeing my doors and windows pictures, so here are a few from Colmar and Riquewihr (more on Riquewihr below).

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Riquewihr</h2>
Riquewihr is a beautiful town in the foothills of the Vosges Mountains. On the second day in Colmar we drove to Riquewihr. Here's a picture of the town from a hill overlooking it.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6993" rel="attachment wp-att-6993"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6993" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01057.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>
Riquewihr has a challenge that many beautiful small towns in France - and other countries - have: there is not much to keep the town alive except tourism, so the town has to promote its charm. But when the tourists come, much of the town's charm is lost in a sea of people. This is the main street of Riquewihr on a day out of the tourist season; think what it must look like in August:
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=6994" rel="attachment wp-att-6994"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6994" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00885.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a>

But there's hope: keeping in mind our friend Ken's observation that "The well-traveled path is not very wide," we walked away from that main street. These pictures are all taken not more than a five minute walk away from that main drag.

We enjoyed visiting Riquewihr but honestly, it's good for a couple hours only. And in August? No way.
<h2>A Surprise: They Make Wine in Alsace!</h2>
Our first night we had dinner in a nice little restaurant in Colmar marked by two things. One, Laurie and I had a main course of pork that ranks among the best pork we have ever had. Maybe it wasn't the pork so much (though it was excellent) but the sauce! Holy cow: some sort of mushroom gravy. Honestly, if I could have ordered a bowl of just that, I would have.&nbsp;

Two, we had a really nice Alsace wine with dinner, and realized the cooperative that sold that wine was about a twenty minute drive from Colmar. So the next day, off we went.&nbsp;

This cooperative sold wines from many local wineries, under the cooperative's label. They had some wine:

[caption id="attachment_7019" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7019" rel="attachment wp-att-7019"><img class="wp-image-7019 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00751.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="410"></a> Lots o' wine...[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7020" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7020" rel="attachment wp-att-7020"><img class="wp-image-7020 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC00754.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> Mary and Gilles checking out the selections Sorry for the slightly fuzzy picture; maybe too much wine tasting?[/caption]

Here's a crazy thing about this wine-buying: the nice wine we'd had at dinner the night before? $7.50 per bottle.&nbsp;

That's it for Colmar and the area around it. We are glad we came to Colmar and saw Riquewihr. It's a new and interesting area for us. Not sure it's on our list of places to re-visit, though. Next post: Mulhouse and its amazing museums.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last stop on our Alsace tour: Mulhouse. Mulhouse differs quite a bit from Strasbourg and Colmar: it's an industrial city that is having a hard time keeping its industrial base. It doesn't have many beautiful and historic buildings nor beautiful parks. The street on which our hotel was located was a bit gritty. But! Mulhouse has a couple amazing museums, and one little-known museum that we wanted to see, so to Mulhouse we went.

A word about the pronunciation of Mulhouse. First, in French 'u' often is pronounced almost as an English 'a', so the Mulhouse part is closer to "ma." Then, the letter 'h' is never pronounced and "s" is pronounced close to the way English pronounces "z". All this means that Mulhouse is pronounced "ma-looze." Took us a while to get that right!

The two well-known museums are the Cité de l'Automobile, an amazing collection of cars; and the Cité de la Train, an amazing collection of railroad stuff. The little-known museum is the <em>Musée De L'Impression Sur Etoffes</em>. <em>Etoffes</em> translates as "printed fabrics;" more about <em>etoffes</em> below.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">The Cité de l'Automobile</h2>
In the early 1900s, the Schlumpf family established a textile factory in Mulhouse. It was a huge success and the family became extraordinarily wealthy as a result. In 1961, Hans and Fritz Schlumpf were at the head of the company and decided to buy classic cars. They amassed a huge collection - some 500 cars - with the idea of opening a museum. Among the collection were some 150 Bugattis, beautiful cars built not far from Mulhouse in Molsheim, France. The brothers bought many cars in parts and formed a shop to restore them as well as many complete vehicles.

This was all great, but they spent so much that they imperiled their textile company. In 1977 the workers of the company learned of the enormous collection and the amount of money spent on it at a time the company was paying them low wages, claiming the company wasn't making money. The workers occupied the company offices, Hans and Fritz fled to Switzerland, the company went out of business and the car collection went into limbo.

An association of automobile clubs and organizations stepped in and bought the collection, for a fraction of its value (44 million francs, worth approximately $11 million; there are two cars in the collection that today are worth about $40 million&nbsp;<em>each!</em>). A couple years later the Cité de l'Automobile opened.

I know, a picture is worth a thousand words, yada-yadda-yadda. Here ya go:
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Bugatti Royales</h2>
Six Bugatti Royales were constructed between 1927 and 1933. To give you an idea of their size:

Length: 21.3 ft
Weight: 7,500 lbs
Engine size: 12.7 liters (715 cu. in.) producing 300 hp (that's a lot for that time)

The Cité de l'Automobile has two of the original Royales. The museum was able to build a third (officially, a replica) from a spare chassis, motor and spare parts in the museum's possession and then <i>hand-building</i> a body for it!

Rather luxurious...[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7035" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7035" rel="attachment wp-att-7035"><img class="wp-image-7035 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01141.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The second Royale in the Museum.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7034" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7034" rel="attachment wp-att-7034"><img class="wp-image-7034 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01089.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The "replica" Royale. There was a full display showing the process of hand-forming the body.[/caption]

The two original Royales would likely go at auction for around $40 million each. The last time one was sold it brought $20 million - in 1999. The replica would bring much less than that, not being an actual production car.&nbsp;
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Other interesting cars, in no particular order:</h2>

I loved the Cité de l'Automobile, but two hours there was all my brain could take, and I know it's not a destination for most people. Honestly, though, so many of these cars are just beautiful, and seeing them in perfect sparkling condition makes this museum worth a visit if you're in the area.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Cité de la Train</h2>
I can hear it now: "Oh, no, another Cité de la Something." Yep, this time for trains.
The French railroad system is run by the <em>Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF)</em>, the "National Company of French Railways." The city of Mulhouse, wanting to draw visitors to the city, donated land to SNCF to display its rolling stock - locomotives and rail cars. The museum is dedicated to the history of trains in France, and stocked with locomotives and railroad cars from the 1840s to today. It had many amazing exhibits - for example, a huge steam locomotive cut in half so the inner workings could be shown and explained.

Another museum that's not for everybody, but another museum we really enjoyed.&nbsp;
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Musée de l'Impression sur Étoffes (The Museum of Printed Textiles)</h2>
Yes, indeed, there is a museum of printed textiles in Mulhouse and we went to it. And enjoyed this one, too.

Turns out that until the late 1700s, printed textiles came from India and pretty much no where else. For some reason, Mulhouse textile factories decided to muscle in on that market and started to industrialize it. Designers came and created beautiful designs, and the manufacturers developed machines to replace the done-by-hand processes. The result was astonishing: Mulhouse quickly became the capital in the world of textile printing, both in quantity and quality.

In the 1820s the manufacturers and designers formed an association that collected and preserved the designs. This became the first Musée de l'Impression sur Étoffes. Since then the museum has expanded its collection to include examples of the machines used, and excellent displays of the design and manufacturing process.

Now, for whatever reason, textiles interest me, so when Laurie learned about this museum, we immediately decided to visit. It's a small place, so only took about an hour (plus an hour for Mary and Laurie in the museum's shop).&nbsp;

Mulhouse still has a large textile industry, but it is no longer dominant.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Home!</h2>
Phew! Now you know all about our nine-day sojourn in Alsace. We were glad to return to our home base in Bois-le-Roi, but we can definitely envision a future return trip, especially to Strasbourg, which deserves a few more days than we gave it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We each have a French <em>Pass Sanitaire</em>! Whenever we go into a restaurant or enclosed venue - think museums - with lots of people, we have to show our vaccination records. The French all have a QR code on their smartphones that the restaurant or venue staff check with an app - it shows that they have been vaccinated. This is the&nbsp;<em>Pass Sanitaire.</em>

Our vaccination records have worked almost 100% (we could not get into a museum in Strasbourg without a&nbsp;<em>Pass Sanitaire</em>, and it took some talking to get into the airshow I went to with Hervé), but we've had lots of "what is this thing?" looks when we showed our vaccination records rather than a <em>pass.</em>&nbsp;

We found out that in late August the French created a way to get our vaccination records into a <em>Pass Sanitaire.</em> So today Gilles and I did the on-line work to get it done and when I finished, Gilles said the site promised an answer in 48 hours. As it turned out, it took about 3 minutes to get a reply email with the QR code necessary. I downloaded the&nbsp;<em>pass sanitaire&nbsp;</em>app, scanned the code and - voilà - we are officially legal. This is not a huge thing, but it will be very nice to just go through the regular, well-known process and not have any questions.

A little thing, maybe, but Big News for us!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're preparing to head off on a four-day trip to the Loire Valley, home of many beautiful chateaus; I'll write a post about that when we return. In the meantime (and afterward) I'll try to post some pictures and scribblings about things we do around our home base, Bois-le-Roi. First up: Chateau Fontainebleau.

We love Chateau Fontainebleau. It has become our go-to place for a walk around when we have some time and don't want to go far for a walk because it's close-by, has beautiful gardens and buildings and a history that we love to contemplate.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7101" rel="attachment wp-att-7101"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7101" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01293.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">A Little Background on Chateau Fontainebleau</h2>
The Chateau Versailles sits outside Paris, about 60 miles from here and is far more popular than Chateau Fontainebleau. We've never been there because 1.) it is jammed with tourists at even the slowest time of the year (and I mean "jammed," as in hour-long waits to get into the famous Hall of Mirrors and then standing shoulder-to-shoulder with your fellow gawkers once you get in), and 2.) it has nothing close to the history of Chateau Fontainebleau. Versailles was built by one king, Louis XIV - the Sun King - and reflects his tastes and no one else's.

Chateau Fontainebleau started as a hunting lodge, and has been added to, changed by, improved upon, and sometimes damaged by kings and emperors since the early-1500s; the roster includes Francis 1st, Henry II, Henry III, Charles IX, Henry IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Napoleon, Louis XVIII, Charles X, Louis-Philippe and Napoleon III. That covers early-1500s to 1870, and some sign of just about every one of those rulers can be seen somewhere in the chateau.

We love just walking around the beautiful grounds of the chateau. There are miles of forest trails, an English garden, a garden dedicated to Diane de Poitier, Henry II's mistress for many years, and a <em>parterre</em>, a wide open space with ponds and flower beds. We can walk for hours if we want and we always have in sight that magnificent chateau.

[caption id="attachment_7100" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7100" rel="attachment wp-att-7100"><img class="wp-image-7100 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01288.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> This pond is about a mile long, and has forests and paths all round it.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7096" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7096" rel="attachment wp-att-7096"><img class="wp-image-7096 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01249.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> What I love about this place. The area above the door has a salamander, the mark of Francois I, who was king from 1514-1547, while the door itself has a monogram added later by Louis XIV - the Sun King mentioned above as the creator of Versailles. He would have installed this door in the 1660s probably.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7099" rel="attachment wp-att-7099"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7099" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01287.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>
Now you know our favorite walking place. It's about a fifteen minute drive from us. We've been a couple times so far, and plan to visit again, to take the chateau tour again (they keep adding things to it). We'll be there for more walks, too; that's for sure.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We took a three-night road trip last week to the Loire Valley. It was a terrific trip; one of those where nothing goes wrong, the weather was great, sights were beautiful and historic and interesting. When we got back, we sat on our little terrace, had a glass of wine and said we didn’t know how the trip could have been better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Loire Valley, which lies east-west two to three hours south of here, is home to many of the most interesting chateaux in France. This is because in the 1400s, as the central government of France formed and strengthened, the monarchy lived in the Loire Valley. Chateaux built during this time were defensive military structures, meant to maintain control of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the monarchy was secure in its role - in the late 1400s and early 1500s - having taken away the power of the local feudal lords, the chateaux no longer needed to be defensive structures. About this time the Renaissance arrived in France and the chateaux went from being secure fortresses to beautiful residences. Local aristocratic families had a ton of money - often way more than the king - and so they built Renaissance chateaux to live the good life and show off their wealth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We visited four chateaux on our ramble. (Long ago we chose to limit ourselves to one a day; that’s all our brains and eyes and legs can take.) The first - Cheverny - and last - Azay-le-Rideau - are pure Renaissance palaces. The second - Blois - was built in the 1400s to militarily control the Loire River and its valley; additions and modifications in the 1500s brought Renaissance in new wings of the chateau. The third - Amboise - was also originally built for military purposes, and had Renaissance flourishes added in subsequent centuries. For each one I’ll do a short post, with pictures, because pictures are far better than words at describing these places.</span></p>
First up: Chateau de Cheverny.]]></content:encoded>

It wa lovely to meet you both at the weekend at La Bijounerie and both Nick and I enjoyed getting a local's insight into all things American!  Much better than that which we are fed by the press.
Penny sent me your blog details so I have just been reading through the Loire posts and Malooze!  I have to say we love Cheverny for its sheer lack of pretentiousness.
I hope you have a marvellous rest of trip and perhaps we shall see you next in the Bearn
Yours Nick and Susie]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you once had a teenage son or daughter, they might well look at a picture of Chateau Cheverny and think, “That seems familiar…” If they were to look at the picture below and cover up the right and left outer wings, it might come to mind: this is Captain Haddock’s Marlinspike Hall, the chateau in the Tintin books that were so popular - with our sons, for sure.</span></p>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tintin-386x254-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7136" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tintin-386x254-1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="296"></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01318.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7122 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01318.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chateau de Cheverny has a long and convoluted history. In the early 1300s the land was owned by the Herault family. A fortified chateau was here in th</span><span class="s1">e early 1500s, still owned by the Herault family. Then things get muddy: the fortified chateau was torn down but no one seems to know exactly when or what it looked like!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Another chateau - less fortified - was then built here.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The chateau was confiscated by the state, and around 1550 Henry II gave it to his life-long mistress Diane de Poitiers. But she liked Chateau Chenonceau better and sold Cheverny back to Philippe Herault - a descendent of the original owners. Philippe Herault built the current chateau between 1624 and 1630.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During Napoleon's time as the head of France the family was required to “sell” (at little or no cost, likely) the property back to the state, but during the Restoration (when France had kings again, after the no-king era of the Revolution and Napoleon’s empire) the family re-gained the property. In 1914 the family opened Chateau de Cheverny to the public, the first to do so. From the first records of the property belonging to the Herault family - early 1300s - to today,&nbsp; still owned by the de Vibraye family, this chateau and property has been in and out of the Herault/de Vibraye family for 800 years!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Okay, enough history - here are some pictures:</span></p>

Chateau Cheverny is famous for its interior decorations, showing how the rooms have been decorated and furnished through the years. As you'll see, some of the rooms had some whimsical additions...

And a note from Captain Haddock, Tintin's guardian...

On the bottom sign Captain Haddock has added some words to make it say, "Chateau is no longer for sale."&nbsp;[/caption]

Many years ago Mary and Gilles took us to Chateau Cheverny, our first chateau. We remember it being beautiful, but honestly, we didn't know enough about France and its history and culture to appreciate it as much as we could have. On this trip, probably twenty-five years and many trips later, we realized again just how beautiful this chateau is. We highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Loire Valley.

As a P.S.: it seems that every year we find a wine that kind of becomes our "wine of the trip." This year we had a red wine from Cheverny the first week of the trip (thank you, Jamie and Hervé) which quickly became our favorite wine of 2021. We've had a lot of Cheverny Rouge!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We left Cheverny and made the half-hour drive to the town of Blois. Here sits one of the most interesting chateaux in all of France, in a very enjoyable city. We made Blois our base of operations for the next three days.

Our arrival in Blois was not without some nervousness: we had to trust the GPS 100% to get us to our hotel; we didn't know anything about the hotel or what it was like; and we didn't know if we'd able to park there - always a problem in an old city like this.

The GPS performed flawlessly, taking us through a twisting and turning route right to the hotel. Which had zero parking. So I drove down a street by the train station and amazingly found on that street one open space that was, even more amazingly, free and unlimited as to how long we could leave the car there. Score!

Then we lugged our stuff back to the hotel and found this lovely lobby and reception area:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7186" rel="attachment wp-att-7186"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7186" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_4642.jpg" alt="" width="864" height="648"></a>

This is it: the entire lobby and reception area of the hotel. No one was there. We rang the bell a few times and a fellow appeared and gave us the impression of not caring a hoot about anything, including his newly-arrived guests. But then he said we needed a bigger room because I’m tall, so he gave us a room upgrade, which was nice. And we were glad he did, because the upgraded room was none too big. We looked in a couple of the regular rooms - they were really small and we would not have been happy in one. Anyway, in the end, the hotel turned out fine, if not exactly luxurious, and Laurie pointed out that it often had the feel of Fawlty Towers. True!

And the kind-of-grumpy fellow at the desk? We think he was grumpy because he did <em>everything</em> at the hotel, except housekeeping. He was at the desk at 11 o'clock at night, and in the breakfast room when it opened at 7 the next morning. Overworked? Oh, yeah. In fact, he turned out to be a good person.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Blois Chateau</h2>
We had read quite a bit about Chateau Blois (mostly in Ina Caro’s book, "Road to the Past." If you are doing some traveling around France, this is a must-read). Chateau Blois has an interesting history, but what’s most interesting are the four wings, each built in a different era of French culture and architecture, so you can stand in the courtyard and see how France changed over three hundred years.

For an overall view of the chateau, take a look at this picture:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7153" rel="attachment wp-att-7153"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7153 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Chateau-de-Blois.jpg" alt="" width="1098" height="768"></a>
The earliest wing is in the lower right-hand corner. Starting there, here are the four wings:

<strong>Gothic</strong> - that structure in the lower right-hand corner, built in the 13th century. This structure was much larger when built, but successive kings demolished parts as they built their own wings, and only this part of the building remains.

[caption id="attachment_7154" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7154" rel="attachment wp-att-7154"><img class="wp-image-7154 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01380.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="427"></a> The Gothic part is stuck between the Flamboyant Gothic wing - the red brick to the right - and the Renaissance on the left.[/caption]

<strong>Flamboyant Gothic</strong> - this section, to the left of the Gothic wing, is marked by the use of red bricks. It was built by Louis XII from 1498 to 1508.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7155" rel="attachment wp-att-7155"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7155" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01382.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="409"></a>
<strong>Renaissance</strong> - this section, on the other side of the Gothic wing, was built by François I, from 1515 to 1519.

[caption id="attachment_7156" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7156" rel="attachment wp-att-7156"><img class="wp-image-7156 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01383.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The Françoise 1 wing was originally symmetrical, with the spiral staircase smack in the middle. When Gaston d'Orleans decided to build his Classical wing (see below) he demolished the left quarter of François's wing. I wish he'd left it intact![/caption]

<strong>Classicism</strong> - this wing was built by Gaston d’Orleans from 1635 to 1638.

[caption id="attachment_7157" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7157" rel="attachment wp-att-7157"><img class="wp-image-7157 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01384.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> Classicism revived Greek architecture, shown by the columns and porticos.[/caption]

So here, in one chateau, we can see 350 years of French architecture. Honestly, we were excited to stand in the middle of the courtyard, listening to the audio guide (the best we’ve ever had, really; it had <i>five</i>&nbsp;narratives just about the different wings and their evolution and creation). We’d read about the chateau and the wings, but we were concerned that we'd get there, look around and not be able to put buildings to eras and architectural styles. Not to worry: the audio guide made sure we could see and understand what each wing represented. Kudos to whoever created that guide!

[caption id="attachment_7158" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?attachment_id=7158" rel="attachment wp-att-7158"><img class="size-full wp-image-7158" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC01395.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The salamander was Françoise 1's icon (he was king from 1515 to 1547). It was believed that the salamander could walk through fire without burning, and could spit fire. Any time you see a salamander similar to this in France, it's an indication that François 1 had a role in the decoration of the building.[/caption]

Maybe because the weather had turned cold, the fireplaces of the Blois chateau caught my eye. You could have a bonfire in these, but considering that the only source of heat in a big, cold, stone room was a fireplace, a bonfire was probably a good thing. There are many like this here:

We spent quite a while at Chateau Blois, and then came back the next night for the&nbsp;<em>son et lumière -&nbsp;</em>the sound and light show. These things used to be kind of primitive, with spotlights and music and narrative in French, but now, they are pretty cool. Using laser lights, they can project characters on the walls, scenes as if in a movie and literally paint the chateau walls to highlight certain parts. Narration is though individual listening devices, so we could have our choice of about twenty languages. Sorry, hard to take a picture of it, so I don't have any.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Jeanne d'Arc at Blois Chateau</h2>
Joan of Arc is&nbsp;<em>the</em> national hero of France. Every city, town, village and wide spot in the road tries to highlight some connection - any connection! - to Joan of Arc. (We heard of one town that she didn't visit, but the town exhibits a letter from her to the town explaining that she wouldn't be able to visit there. Given that she was illiterate, the letter is almost certainly a forgery, but the town displays it anyway.)

But Chateau Blois has a solid connection with Jeanne d'Arc. At the end of April, 1429, she spent several days in Blois, at the head of an army she had been given to lift the siege (by the English) of the city of Orleans. She left Blois, did in fact attack the English at Orleans and defeated them. The&nbsp;<em>son et lumière&nbsp;</em>explains that she prayed in the chateau chapel before she led her army to Blois. Well, maybe she did and maybe she prayed in another, long-gone chapel, but it makes for a good story.

Chateau Blois was the primary reason for our trip to the Loire Valley this year and it did not disappoint. In fact, we had high expectations of this chateau and it exceeded those expectations. A fabulous place.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">The City of Blois</h2>
The city that holds the chateau is worth some time, too It sits on a steep hillside next to the Loire River and though one would think it would be touristy, it isn't. Not that there weren't the ubiquitous souvenir shops, but they didn't line the streets. Blois really is an interesting city in its own right, and we enjoyed a bit of exploration here.

<h3 style="font-family: verdana;">Some old and interesting streets</h3>
One thing we liked is that these streets, which one could expect would be lined with tourist-oriented shops, were not. The stores here were just regular stores, meant to serve residents.

We really liked Blois, both the Chateau and the town. It's on our rather lengthy list of places we hope to visit again in the future.

Next up (in a few days): Chateau Amboise and Chateau Azay-le-Rideau.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0255.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7300 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0255.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="600"></a>

In late August great friend Hervé, his daughter Sophia, son Ben, Ben's friend Jurgen and I went to the La Ferté Alais airshow. A couple days ago Hervé beat me soundly (figuratively) about the head and shoulders for not doing a post on the airshow. I plead guilty! We had a great day and I should have done a post long ago. But, better never late than ever (or something like that), so here goes.

A note of caution: if you're not interested in old airplanes, you can skip right on by this post. I certainly will not take offense.

I've been a fan of old planes for years (okay, okay, I've been a fan of all planes for years), and I've gone to a lot of airshows. I can say that the Fête Aérienne La Ferté Alais is my favorite. We came here in 2015 or 2016 but the 2020 show was canceled and the 2021 show, scheduled for May, seemed to be canceled. But the organizers decided to just postpone the airshow a few months and so the last weekend of August, rather than the last weekend of May, we had an airshow!

Now, I don't want to rag on other airshows, but often they are fly-bys of some interesting airplanes and then about 450 aerobatic demonstrations. One aerobatic display is good, two not so good and from three on, boring! La Ferté Alais takes a different approach. Many of the planes on display here fly in staged "actions." For instance, there were a number of World War I airplanes, and they all took to the sky at the same time and staged a mock dogfight. That was followed by vignettes with airplanes from between the wars, then World War II airplanes, then more modern planes. In between lots of planes took off, flew by a couple times and landed, all right in front of us.

The last two performances were <em>Patrouille de France</em> and a solo demonstration by a Dassault <em>Rafale</em>. <em>Patrouille de France</em> is the French Air Force demonstration team, like the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels and the U.S. Air Force's Thunderbirds. Now I've seen the Blue Angels many times and I gotta say, <em>Patrouille de France</em> does some stuff I've <em>never&nbsp;</em>seen the Blue Angels do. This was followed by a solo demonstration by the <em>Rafale</em>, which is absolutely jaw-dropping.

A very fun day with good friends and great airplanes; what could be better?
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Pix:</h2>
Herve took a flight in a 1930s Boeing Stearman. There were quite a few airplanes at the airshow that will take passengers for a short flight. Hervé wouldn't say how much his flight cost, saying only, "It was worth it" when asked.

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Really Old Planes</h2>
These are planes from the 1900-1914 era. Even though the United States had the first real heavier-than-air aircraft (the famous Wright brothers and their Wright Flier), France led the aviation world during these years. These planes are pretty much perfect replicas of early French airplanes. All of these planes flew together in the afternoon and what struck me - besides how flimsy they are - is how slow they are; I'd guess they never got over about 50 miles per hour.

This plane flew in the afternoon WWII segment and was pretty amazing to hear.[/caption]

When I was in the Navy, these had just been retired from active combat in Vietnam. Spad pilots garnered more respect than any other pilots, including fighter pilots. These planes were hugely powerful and a real handful to fly. I cannot imagine how much it must cost to restore and fly something like this; it must burn a few hundred dollars of fuel per flight hour.[/caption]

Thanks for "coaxing" me into writing this post, Hervé. It reminded me of what a great day that was.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After seeing Chateau Blois and visiting the town, we took a day-trip to go to Chateau Amboise and then stopped at Chateau Azay-le-Rideau on the day we drove back to home base at Bois-le-Roi. This was the second time we'd visited Chateau Amboise and the fourth(!) time at Azay-le-Rideau. You can get some more info about these two chateaux by clicking on: <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=4833">2018: Three Loire Chateaux</a>.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Chateau Amboise</h2>
Chateau Amboise, a thirty-minute drive from Blois, sits on a point of land between the Loire river and what used to be the Amasse river (which is now under the town of Amboise). From this position the chateau and its owners - and their armies - could control the entire central Loire Valley. In the 1400s and 1500s, when the French monarchy lived in the Loire Valley, a number of kings and queens were raised here or lived here in their later lives. Henry II and his wife Catherine D'Medici raised three future kings and a future queen at this chateau.

Today it looks as it did in the 1500s, commanding a beautiful view of the Loire River and the town of Amboise. We very much enjoyed our return here.

The Loire Valley has become a favorite area for us.[/caption]

The town is pretty touristy, but we walked a ways to find a restaurant off the beaten path that we enjoyed last trip. It was still there, still excellent.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Chateau Azay-le-Rideau</h2>
Chateau Azay-le-Rideau is 100% Renaissance, and we love it. We first visited it maybe 15 years ago and have been back three times since. It's not huge or famous, but we can spend a lot of time just sitting and looking at it and enjoying its beauty.

We learned on this trip that for many years this chateau had a collection of portraits of French people unsurpassed anywhere. In the early 1900s much of the collection was sold to ease a financial strain on the family, but some fifty of the best were retained. They were displayed here for the first time in many decades. We saw portraits of royalty and aristocrats. A good addition to the chateau.&nbsp;

Many rooms are decorated and furnished in styles appropriate to the years of the chateau. We liked seeing those, too. But the star of this show is the chateau itself, so here are some pictures of it.

And have done just that.[/caption]

That's the end of our Loire Valley ramble. We drove back to Bois-le-Roi (an "interesting" drive, but we made it) and have since spent a lot of time remembering how much we enjoyed it. Honestly, everything went well: we had great weather, some excellent dinners, and saw lots of beautiful sights. A perfect trip!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've often claimed that we're not great fans of modern art - that it too often leaves us scratching our heads and wondering about what we were seeing. Over the last few years we've come to appreciate some modern art: outdoor sculptures and murals and paintings (and Banksy), and we've always liked what Cristo and Jeanne-Claude (his wife) created: "...site-specific environmental installations." That is, they created installations that temporarily changed - in a big way - some place or building or structure. The installations remained only a few days and then they returned the place to its original condition. A favorite style for Cristo and Jeanne-Claude was to wrap huge things. Sound crazy? Yes, but they create a powerful effect.

Finally, we got to see a Cristo installation. Although he died last year (Jeanne-Claude died in 2009), Cristo's team carried out his last project: wrapping <em>l'Arc de Triomphe</em> in Paris. Like most of Cristo's installations, it has a short life: finished on Sept 18, it will remain in place for two weeks; fortunately for us that two weeks coincided with a visit we made to Paris this week.&nbsp;

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cristo1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7275 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cristo1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cristo2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7276 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cristo2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a>
I have no doubt that some folks are scratching their heads and wondering "???" and I understand that. But we thought this was cool and interesting and beautiful and powerful. We're glad to have seen Cristo and Jeanne-Claude's last work.

P.S. When our son Craig saw these pictures, he asked why when he was a teenager and wrapped things with toilet paper, it was called "vandalism" but Cristo's work is called "art." We laughed at that!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I haven't taken a lot of pictures of food here, because I'm not 100% ok with pulling out a phone and taking pictures in a nice restaurant. But I've been talked into posting the food pix I have so here they are. You'll notice that they lean to the dessert side...

(In 2015 I posted about buying food on a day-to-day basis here. If you're interested, it's at&nbsp;<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=2126">Buying Food Here</a> . About the only thing that has changed is we have found great produce and fruit [and inexpensive wine] at a fairly new grocery store near us, so we don't hit the street markets as often as we did that year.)
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Produce</h2>
Here are some pix taken in the stores at which we shop. We think that fruit and produce here is fresher and tastier than at home.

[caption id="attachment_7318" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0639-2-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7318" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0639-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="864" height="648"></a> Leeks. Big leeks.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7328" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0642.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7328" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0642.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a> Really fresh green beans, and lots of them.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7327" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0641-2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7327 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0641-2.jpg" alt="" width="864" height="648"></a> Mushrooms - a tiny selection of the mushrooms available here.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7320" align="aligncenter" width="864"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0640.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7320" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0640.jpg" alt="" width="864" height="648"></a> Part of the produce section at our local store. Look at the size of that lettuce. The origin of each item is listed, so you know where it came from.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7326" align="aligncenter" width="900"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_4462.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7326" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_4462.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> Laurie had to fight this head of lettuce for ten minutes to get it into a bag.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Desserts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_7335" align="aligncenter" width="900"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0673.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7335" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0673.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> Chocolate, four ways. All of them great.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7334" align="aligncenter" width="900"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0672.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7334" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0672.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> We ordered this after we realized that "<em>tarte de prune</em>" isn't exactly what we thought. "Prune" translates to "plum." It was, of course, excellent.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0663.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7332 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0663.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0662.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7331 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0662.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0661.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7330 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0661.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a>

[caption id="attachment_7324" align="aligncenter" width="900"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0660.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7324" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0660.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> <em>Chocolate moelleux</em>. This is cooked so that the chocolate on the outsides forms a cake, but the chocolate inside stays melted. It is another favorite.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7323" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0649.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7323" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0649.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a> On the menu (in <em>Montreuil-sur-Mer</em>) these were listed as "<em>profiteroles authentiques</em>." Good thing, because I would not want <em>faux</em> profiteroles. The "<em>authentique</em>" means everything in them was made at the restaurant.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7322" align="aligncenter" width="450"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0648.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7322" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0648.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a> A rhubarb tarte.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7437" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0758.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7437" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0758.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a> Probably the most beautiful patisserie cakes we've ever seen. Also the most expensive: for a cake serving four people, $35 - $45; for a six-person cake, $40 - $70![/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Miscellaneous Food Pix</h2>
[caption id="attachment_7343" align="aligncenter" width="900"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_4459.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7343" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_4459.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> France has taken to the hamburger in a big way, but not like American hamburgers. We have not seen one that we could pick up and eat; a hamburger here is a knife-and-fork endeavor. This one is probably the shortest we have seen, and I couldn't have gotten a bite of it.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7344" align="aligncenter" width="900"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_4505.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7344" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_4505.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> Lunch in <em>Montreuil-sur-Mer</em>. The bowl at bottom-right is not soup; it's rarebit: melted cheese over toast. Next to it: a salad. Above the salad, beef stew. Next to the beef stew, frites (of course). Post-lunch naps required.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7333" align="alignnone" width="900"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0668.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7333" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0668.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="675"></a> That's nougat. A lot of nougat. I didn't buy it, though I was tempted.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7340" align="aligncenter" width="450"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0689.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7340" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0689-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a> Not exactly a typical at-home lunch for us, but not far off. I suspect the French would castigate us for this, but we've had more than a few lunches of cheese and bread, fruit and a glass of wine. This is three cheeses and a slice of paté.[/caption]

We found the restaurant again this year and had the same salad. If we return to Amboise, we'll have it then, too![/caption]

That's my food post; not a lot of pictures for ten weeks, I admit, but if I took a picture of every good lunch and dinner we've had, this blog would be nothing but food pictures!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week we spent four days in Paris, certainly our last visit to the city on this trip. We've been coming to Paris for many years - our first time in the city was in 1983: two day-trips while we were staying with Mary and Gilles in Chartrettes. Our first stay in the city, probably four or five days, was ten years later. Since then we've spent time here on probably ten or twelve vacations. We loved this city from the start and have only grown to love it more each visit. So it was hard to walk back to the flat and then the train station knowing it will be a while before we're back.

We had a great four days in Paris, though Tuesday started with an unbelievable downpour. After that, though, the weather turned clear and cold. We can always add another layer, so off we went. Here are some pictures of our time in our favorite city.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Notre Dame</h2>
You likely remember seeing pictures of Notre Dame burning in April, 2019, and I wrote a bit about it after our first stay in Paris in August. Restoration has just started; engineers worked two years to stabilize the Cathedral enough that the work of restoration could start. This beautiful building came close to completely collapsing in the fire; huge kudos to the firefighters who saved it.

After much discussion, the powers-that-be decided to restore Notre Dame to its pre-fire appearance (a decision with which I whole-heartedly agree). There will surely be some changes and it will be much more resistant to catastrophes, but it will look almost exactly as it has for 800 years.&nbsp;

Restoration schedule: François Macron, President of France, wants it open for the 2024 Olympics to be held in France. It may be open then, but the schedule for full restoration calls for almost twenty years(!) of work.

You can see the scaffolding that envelopes much of the central part of the building.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7369" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01736.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7369 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01736.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The entire south side of Notre Dame, from across the Seine. The towers at the left survived the fire by fast and smart work by the firefighters. The fire got into the towers and had the firefighters not stopped it almost immediately, the towers would have collapsed, bringing the entire Cathedral down with them.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01738.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7371" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01738.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>

[caption id="attachment_7372" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01756.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7372 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01756.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> Even in it's "under-repair" state, Notre Dame still dominates the sky here, and keeps its title as an iconic image of Paris. I don't know of a better known Church anywhere in the world.[/caption]

<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Look Up!</h2>
If someone asks me about visiting Paris, one of my regular bits of advice is: "Look up." Paris is full of beautiful buildings. Here are a few we saw this trip:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01716.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7390" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01716.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01712.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7389" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01712.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="408"></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01708.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7388" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01708.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a>

[caption id="attachment_7412" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC00143.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7412 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC00143.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="499"></a> There is, of course, the occasional clunker. Don't know what the architect of this building was thinking, or if he or she was thinking at all.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Two Favorite Churches</h2>
Within a five minute walk of Notre Dame are two churches that we like a lot. The first is <em>Saint-Julian-le-Pauvre</em>. This is a tiny church that holds a strong claim as the oldest church in Paris, having been built over a 6th century church. Since 1889, <em>Saint-Julian-le-Pauvre</em> has been a Greek Orthodox church; the first time I stepped into it four or five years ago a service was in progress. The church continues to hold Greek Orthodox services, and also presents musical concerts almost every week.
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01740.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7375 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01740.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01752.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7376 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01752.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a>

The other favorite church is <em>Saint-Severin</em>, just a hundred yards from <em>Saint-Julian-le-Pauvre</em>. This church has some Romanesque arches in the nave and about every type of Gothic known: early, flamboyant, neo-, etc. It, too, is not a huge Church, and it doesn't draw crowds, so it is a place of beauty and peace. For us, it's a lovely place to just sit.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01772.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7382 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01772.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="600"></a><a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01764.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7380 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01764.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01762.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7378 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01762.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a>

[caption id="attachment_7381" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01768.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7381 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01768.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> Gotta love a beautiful organ.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">River Walk</h2>
After visiting <em>Saint-Julian-le-Pauvre</em> and <em>Saint-Severin</em>, it was time to start back. We walked to the north side of the Seine (the Right Bank, as it's known) and walked along the river.

Our first few trips to Paris, I whined about how few places there were where people could walk along the river. Fortunately, things have changed, as there are now several miles of walks along the Seine. Right next to the river runs a former two-lane freeway that transported tens of thousands of cars a day. A few years back the city closed the road to cars on Sundays and opened it to walkers, runners, skateboarders, bikers, strollers, scooters.&nbsp; Then a couple years ago the mayor of Paris closed it off permanently, thus earning the ire of thousands of motorists. The payoff, though, has been fabulous for us walkers.

[caption id="attachment_7397" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01778.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7397 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01778.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="443"></a> A heavily-used "highway' down the Right Bank, turned into a walkers/bikers/runners paradise. Drivers are less enthused, but we think this is by far the best use of this road.[/caption]

Some pictures of Paris from our walk down the river...

[caption id="attachment_7392" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01773.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7392 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01773.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="384"></a> The Conciergerie, long a notorious prison, now a government office building.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7406" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01790.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7406" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01790.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> School-kids enjoying the walkway and a beautiful day.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7396" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01777.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7396" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01777.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> A corner of <em>Ile de la Cité</em>, home of Notre Dame. This is the only part of the island where residences were spared the clearing and rebuilding wrought by Baron Von Haussman in the 1870s.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7404" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01804.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7404" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01804.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> Looking across at Ile St. Louis. You are seeing here some of the most expensive residences in Paris: a 230 sq. ft. studio apartment is listed for $400,000; a nice 750 sq. ft. two-bedroom goes for $1.4 million.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7402" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7402" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01801.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> Nice place to eat lunch...[/caption]

Then, it was on the bus, back to the flat, pack up and head for the train station. As we walked along the river, we said, again and again, how much we love Paris, and how we will always have a plan for the next trip there. Have to have something to look forward to through the approaching winter, and Paris is what we'll be remembering and looking forward to again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One day while walking down our street, we saw this in a wall near our cottage:

[caption id="attachment_7460" align="aligncenter" width="350"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01930.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7460" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01930.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="470"></a> This well started our search. It's about a hundred yards from our cottage here in Bois-le-Roi.[/caption]

It's an old unused well; we could see the pulley and bucket on a chain.There is a locked grill on the front so it cannot be used (and so kids and animals don't fall down it!). We thought that was kind of interesting.

Then we found a historical marker sign on another street with a narrative about <em>les</em> <em>puits communes</em> (common wells) that were in this area when it was the commercial and residential center of Bois-le-Roi. There were many of these common wells, which the residents and businesses in the area used.

The sign said that thirteen of the wells, built around 1850, still exist. Ah-hah! The search was on. A challenge is that the sign said the wells were built in walls along the street (almost all houses here have walls around the property) but some wells were built in courtyards, which generally are now completely enclosed.

So on our almost-daily walks, we kept an eye out for <em>puits</em>. More than once I walked right by one and Laurie would have to call me back to show me. In the end, we found twelve for sure and one maybe, but the maybe turned out to be a no. Several of them are in courtyards which required some "over the wall peeping." One we can see only the roof and about six inches of the opening. Eight of them are on walls, five are in courtyards (which took some searching to find).

For your viewing pleasure, here are the <em>puits</em> we've found, in no particular order:

I suspect a few of you faithful readers are saying, "They've lost it for sure." Probably, but I will say that it was fun to search these wells up, and have a little connection with the local history.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier I wrote about walking around Chateau Fontainebleau, one of our favorite walks here (<a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=7094">Around Bois-le-Roi – Chateau Fontainebleau</a>). Yesterday we returned to the chateau, not for a walk but to visit the interior. We've done this before - as in, three or four times before! - but we have enjoyed every visit and wanted to see it again before we left.

A very short history of the chateau: originally a hunting lodge for the French kings, in the first half of the 1500s, François 1 built probably 90% of what exists today. After François, every king and emperor of France added to - and in some cases, subtracted from - Chateau Fontainebleau. This makes Chateau Fontainebleau a museum of the French monarchy - everywhere you see changes made by successive kings and queens, often identified by those kings' and queens' monograms.

We had two pleasant surprises: first, more of the chateau has been restored and open to visitors; and second, the place was deserted. This made the visit much more enjoyable than being there as part of a crowd, even though Chateau Fontainebleau never approaches the crowds of Versailles.
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Napoleon</h2>
The emperor Napoleon spent quite a bit of time at Chateau Fontainebleau, both with his first wife, Josephine, and his second, Maria-Theresa, so the chateau has collected a fair amount of Napoleon memorabilia and displays it in a small museum. Here are two of my favorite things there.

[caption id="attachment_7482" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01819.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7482 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01819.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> Napoleon's famous hat and battle coat. He wore these in several battles. What you can't see from this picture is how short he was: 5' 6" at the most.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7483" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01820.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7483 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01820.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The crib of Napoleon's only legitimate child, Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte. When Napoleon abdicated the first time, in 1814, he named this son Napoleon II as his successor. France was having none of that, refused to give him any power, and stripped him of the title after two weeks. He went to Austria where he lived until dying of tuberculosis at age 21.[/caption]
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Crowds</h2>
We have been through Chateau Fontainebleau three or four times before, and while it's never been really crowded (one of its attractions, we think), there have always been a fair number of fellow gawkers. This trip? Not so much.

[caption id="attachment_7488" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01846.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7488" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01846.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The Gallery Françoise I. He brought the Renaissance to France, and this gallery is his crowning achievement in that respect. Notice the hoards of people.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7487" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01843.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7487" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01843.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="415"></a> A view onto the gardens from the gallery.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7491" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01867.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7491 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01867.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="412"></a> The Ball Room, probably our favorite room in the chateau. &nbsp;Henry IV (ruled 1589-1610) had most of the decoration done during his reign. There are many triple "new moons" ("crescents," in French, <em>croissants</em>), Henri's symbol, and intertwined Hs and Ms (the M for Maria d'Medici, his second wife).[/caption]
<h2>Cour Ovale</h2>
The Cour Ovale. This space has been the center of the chateau since it was first built, although the buildings forming it now were built mostly in the 1500s. For years I've looked out windows and through a gate and wished we could walk in it, but it has always been closed to the public. No longer! Visitors to the chateau can now stroll around the Cour Ovale, and we took full advantage! I love this courtyard and was very happy to be able to spend twenty minutes in it. A lot of historic people entered the chateau through the Cour Ovale.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01901.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7493 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01901.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="411"></a>

[caption id="attachment_7494" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01911.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7494" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01911.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="426"></a> The main gate into the Cour Ovale and the chateau.[/caption]

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01915.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7495" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01915.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a>
As we (finally) left the Cour Ovale, I told Laurie that now I could die happy, having been there. An exaggeration, of course, but it was very fun to walk around this exceedingly beautiful courtyard that we'd had to look at from the outside for years!
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Some Other Pix</h2>
[caption id="attachment_7497" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01924.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7497 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01924.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> This is <em>the</em> throne Napoleon used when he was at Fontainebleau. Napoleon was an enigmatic figure and I'm not sure anyone will ever be able to say whether he was good or bad for France. But no one can deny that he was a force. I'm fascinated by him and his place in history, but when I asked some French friends what the French think of him 200 years after his death, the response was, "They don't think of him at all."[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7496" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01921.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7496 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01921.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="415"></a> Maybe the most beautiful library in the world, eh? This is the Diana Gallery, built by Henry IV and named after the goddess of the hunt, Diana.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7490" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01857.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7490 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01857.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> Now, here's a ceiling![/caption]
<h2>The Trinity Chapel</h2>
[caption id="attachment_7485" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01827.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7485 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01827.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="429"></a> The upper level, for the royal family, so they didn't have to mingle with the "hoi-polloi."[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7499" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01928.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7499 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01928.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"></a> The "hoi-polloi" level. Remember, the folks down here were aristocrats and courtiers of the royal family, but they had to stay in their place, even in the chapel.[/caption]

Now you've seen the outside and inside of Chateau Fontainebleau. Our visit exceeded our expectations; new rooms had been restored and opened, we walked around the Cour Ovale and admired it, we had entire rooms and galleries to ourselves. Honestly, when we return, we'll be back for our walks in the chateau's gardens, and we will almost surely pay the admission to walk through the chateau's rooms again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm writing this from home, back in Renton. We flew from Paris to St. Louis four weeks ago, spent a week with Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry, then came home three weeks ago. Are we happy to be back? Yes, as always. Were we sorry to leave France? Yes, as always. Sorry to leave St. Louis and Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry? Yes, as always.
<h2>The Return</h2>
Sunday, Oct. 17 we got up about 7 in the morning, finished packing, cleaned the cottage that had been our home for two and a half months, and headed off to the airport. We had everything we needed, including &nbsp;COVID-19 tests done three days before, a "Letter of Attestation" swearing that we had not been around anyone with COVID recently, passports, boarding passes, etc. The drive, planned for a Sunday morning to avoid what can be horrendous traffic, was okay except for some horrendous traffic caused by an accident. But we had plenty of time so <em>pas de problem.</em>

We got to the car-return place, turned in the car, shuttled to the airport, checked the bags, went through passport control in about two minutes and then hit security. Ugh! Long lines, surly employees, and a continuous request for some document or other: COVID test, now the Attestation form, now boarding cards (two or three times), a hand check of my laptop bag, boarding passes again, etc. Just tiring.

Flight to Atlanta was fine, went through Global Entry (Immigration and Passport control) in about 2 minutes (if you're traveling internationally, spend the time and money to get Global Entry; well worth it), thirty minute wait for bags which we then immediately put on a conveyor belt to go to the connecting flight, another poor experience going through security (no TSA PreCheck), and a two and a half hour wait for the flight to St. Louis.

We got to St. Louis and had a wonderful surprise when Clara was at the airport (with Craig) at midnight to meet us. She had blue-green hair, and I didn't recognize her for a few seconds! Then, hugs all around. It was a wonderful welcome to see her there.

Usually when we arrive at Craig and Annie's, it's a drink and then bed. This time we skipped the drink. We had been up for almost exactly 25 hours and were physically and mentally whupped. I think we slept until about 10 the next morning.

I'll post a report on our week in St. Louis (spoiler alert: we had a great time!)
<h2>A Quick France Summary</h2>
What was the best thing about our two and a half months in France? Spending more time than ever with our French "family." When we planned this trip, we said the thing we wanted to do most was spend more time with our friends there; often they're on vacation or busy or we're off on some ramble; this trip we wanted to see them more. Well, we succeeded! All our friends made time for us - the first week we had a gathering the first night, the second night and the fifth night, and things didn't slow down too much from there.&nbsp;

So, Mary and Gilles, Jamie and Hervé, Pierre and Penny, Yves and Valerie, Riitta and Benôit, Lesly and Pierre: <em>merci à vous</em> for making our stay the best ever. We just can't thank all of you enough for including us in so many wonderful, happy, memorable times. You're the best! We miss you all!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We arrived in St. Louis pretty whupped from the flights from France but glad to be there. We got to the airport about midnight and had the <em>great</em> pleasure of seeing Clara there - we hadn't expected that! The next day was a kind of hanging around day, taking a nap, just relaxing and catching up.&nbsp;

When we came through St. Louis on the way to France in July, Craig and Annie's furniture and household stuff arrived the morning after we arrived, so the house was, in a word, disorganized. This time, of course, it was a real home, with everything in place. We can tell you that it is a really nice house, in an excellent neighborhood, with lots to do and see. We will definitely explore more on future visits and we're looking forward to doing that.&nbsp;

This trip, we relaxed and got back in United States mode and we also saw some very interesting and cool things: a fabulous botanical garden, and the National Transportation Museum and a&nbsp;park with contemporary sculptures

First though, the most important thing: pictures of Clara and Henry!

<h2>Missouri Botanical Gardens</h2>
This botanical garden is not more than ten or twelve minutes from Craig and Annie's house and it is beautiful. We spent a couple hours here and could have spent more. It has a wonderful tropical building, a beautiful Japanese Garden, a children's garden and much more.&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_7543" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-8.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7543 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-8.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800"></a> You can see that we had a beautiful day to visit the botanical garden. I think it was high-70s that day.[/caption]

<h2>National Transportation Museum</h2>
Although this is the National Transportation Museum, the transportation is heavily oriented toward rail-based modes. There are many locomotives, of all ages, freight cars, passenger cars, trams and trolleys and streetcars. Then there are maybe 25 automobiles, one boat and one airplane. Since I bored you with the post on the <em>Cité de la Train</em> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/?p=7029">(Mulhouse)</a> in France, I won't bore you with lots of pictures from here. Maybe a few...
<h2>Big Boy&nbsp;</h2>
This locomotive has fascinated me since I first saw one on display in Cheyenne, Wyoming, home of the Union Pacific. The Union Pacific built twenty-five "Big Boy" locomotives between 1942 and 1945; they are the biggest locomotives ever, 132 ft long and weighing 1.2 million pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_7546" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-11.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7546 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-11.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800"></a> "Big Boy" - aptly named, I'd say.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7545" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-10.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7545 size-large" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-10-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960"></a> I've always wondered what the view was from the engineer's seat. Visitors could climb into Big Boy's cab to see what what the engineer saw: not much![/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7544" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-9.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7544 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-9.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900"></a> Want an idea of how big this locomotive is? Look at the very end of it, on the right side of the picture. That's me waving out the fireman's window.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7547" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-12.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7547" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-12.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800"></a> Craig and Laurie in front of Big Boy's driving wheels. There are 32 of those wheels![/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7548" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-13.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7548" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-13.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800"></a> Thought to be the oldest surviving locomotive in the United States.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_7549" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-14.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7549 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-14.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800"></a> This is a streetcar from the San Francisco Muni Railroad. I remember seeing these going up and down Market Street. I probably rode on one sometime.[/caption]

For someone who enjoys old trains, this place is heaven - lots of interesting equipment around, some of it restored, much of it not. There seemed to be no restrictions as to where we could go, so we walked all over it. Lots of fun.

We also visited a park with many outdoor sculptures of the modern type, and a great city park, with playgrounds, walks, a huge swimming complex, an ice-skating rink and a bunch of other stuff.&nbsp;

You can tell we like St. Louis! We'll be back for Christmas, when it's likely the weather will not be so amenable to getting out. But we'll try!
<h2>Wrapping It Up</h2>
After a week of great times here, we headed for the airport. Gotta say that the St. Louis airport is becoming a favorite; it's small, well-organized and not all that busy. Almost makes flying fun again.

We returned to Seattle on October 25, three months to the day after we had left there. As always, we were sad to leave France, sad to leave Craig and Annie and Clara and Henry, and glad to be back home. We're already planning and looking forward to future travels - as a great friend says, "Making memories." Thanks to all of you for joining us on our travels via this blog. For now...wrapping it up.&nbsp;]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know that thousands of readers look at this blog to read about our travels inside and outside the U.S. of A., and so may be slightly disappointed that this blog is about our Christmas trip to St. Louis. Honestly, I won't feel slighted if you skip right on by. But a big reason I do this blog is so that Laurie and I can look back and say, 'Oh, yeah, we remember that." And if you want to see what the Zumsteg family looks like now, and learn a little bit about St. Louis, give it a read!
<h2>Some St. Louis Background</h2>
We actually have an old connection with St. Louis. In 1853 my great-grandfather, Widillin "Wendall" Zumsteg, then six years old, emigrated with his parents and some family members (don't know who yet) from a tiny village in Switzerland, about a mile south of the Switzerland/Germany border. Where did he emigrate to? St. Louis. For unknown reasons a few - maybe more than a few - &nbsp;Zumsteg families made that trip in the early 1850s. Many moved on to St. Joseph, MO, and my Zumsteg ancestors moved to a tiny town, Memphis, Missouri, on the border between Missouri and Iowa.

Today there are quite a few Zumstegs in Missouri. Craig said that he once started to spell his name for someone and they stopped him, since they knew other Zumstegs. Someday we'll make a run up to Memphis (population: 1,700) to see the town where my grandfather was born, and visit the cemetery where his parents (my great-grandparents) and several siblings are buried.

As for my great-grandfather Wendall Zumsteg, I have no information about his history in the United States. But he lives on: my grandfather's name was Jacob Wendell Zumsteg, and my middle name is Wendell.
<h2>The Trip</h2>
I think both regular readers of this blog know that our daughter-in-law, Annie, is hands-down the best daughter-in-law ever. No, really. When we were in St. Louis in October, we planned to bring up whether we should come back for Christmas, knowing that it was only two months away, and knowing that sometimes guests can come a little too often and stay a little too long. We didn't get a chance to bring up the subject; Annie asked us to please, please come at Christmas. We pointed out that we didn't want to leave Derek alone in Portland, so she texted him an invite and by the next day it was all confirmed: all the Z's would be in St. Louis for the holidays. We think it's been at least 25 years since we've all been together, and then, Craig and Annie didn't even know each other and grandkid Z's were a long way off.

[caption id="attachment_7591" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-3.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7591 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> The whole fambly together again! At a coffee shop in Kirkwood. It was clear and cold that day.[/caption]

We got to do some sightseeing. Here's the St. Louis Arch. From a distance, it's interesting, but up-close? It's really impressive.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7592 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="419"></a>
<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7593 aligncenter" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>
&nbsp;We got in lots of walks, as the weather was excellent. Christmas Eve day was sunny and 74°! We walked through an outdoor sculpture park with some interesting installations:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-14.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7601" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-14.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a> <a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-13.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7600" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-13.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a>

Have you ever had that feeling that someone was looking at you? At this sculpture park, we &nbsp; encountered that feeling strongly, but never figured out what it was.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eyeball.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7614" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eyeball.jpg" alt="" width="2016" height="1512"></a>

The most interesting thing in the park was an owl, sitting in a tree by the side of a path. &nbsp;We've never been this close to an owl in the wild.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-15.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7602" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-15.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a>

We walked through a Farmers' Market in Kirkwood which was selling trees and saw this one. Yikes!

<h2>St. Charles</h2>
We visited St. Charles, about 30 minutes north of Craig and Annie's house, on the Missouri River. St. Charles has many beautiful restored buildings from the late 1800's/early-1900s, but honestly it's a little cutesy, especially decorated for Christmas. I wrote some about the dilemma for towns like this when we visited one in France: to stay alive, they have to attract tourists; to attract tourists, they have to prettify themselves far beyond what they looked like in their prime. Prettifying themselves draws crowds of tourists and sightseers, which detracts from the "authenticity" of the town. No easy answer here - I'd like to see the towns maintain their 100-year-old selves, but then they'd disappear for lack of a reason for existing. Anyway, St. Charles:

Henry came down with some type of flu (wasn't COVID-Omicron, evidently, as he tested negative) and for a couple days he definitely was not his high-energy self:

We had a great time in St. Louis, from start to finish. A couple days later Annie wrote that she was extending an invitation for us to come to St. Louis for Christmas for the next ten years. See what I said about her being the best daughter-in-law ever? We accepted the invitation.

Then, we had to fly back to Seattle.&nbsp;
<h2>Return Flight</h2>
Now things got, um, "interesting." First, Laurie caught Henry's flu. Tuesday night (we left Wednesday), she started to hack and cough, had some head congestion and a bit of a sore throat. Departure day she felt worse and continued to go downhill as the day progressed.

On the other side of the country - Seattle, that is - a huge snow storm had snarled air travel big-time. The day before, the St. Louis - Seattle flight was cancelled and another big snow storm was forecast to hit Seattle late Wednesday night. So we were a little worried about getting home. Fortunately, the flights operated on our departure day and we arrived at SeaTac at exactly 10 p.m., one hour late. "No problem," thought I. "We'll get our bags, catch an Uber or Lyft and be home by 11:30. Right.

Unfortunately, that "late Wednesday night" snowstorm had arrived three hours before our arrival, and SeaTac was a mess. We waited on the plane for&nbsp;an hour&nbsp;before it got to a gate, then waited 50 minutes&nbsp;to get our bags - in a baggage claim area with <em>thousands</em> of people. During this time I was checking, with growing dismay, the Uber and Lyft apps. A ride from the airport to home usually is about $32-$34, plus tip. Lyft was now showing that ride would cost $155, but not to worry about the cost, because they had zero drivers available. Uber was saying $85, and they had "few drivers" so couldn't guarantee that we could get a ride. Gulp.

Our bags arrived after about 50 minutes. Off to the ground transportation area we went.&nbsp;I thought maybe we could just catch a regular taxi home. Right again. The line - outdoors in 24° temps - was about 200 yards long, with a taxi arriving maybe every five minutes. I figured the taxi wait was at least two hours. We walked out to the Lyft/Uber area; I checked Uber and amazingly, it showed a driver available in seven minutes at that $85 cost. Honestly, I didn't believe it, but I took the ride and, sure enough, the driver showed up about five minutes later.&nbsp;

Now, I don't know where the driver was from, but I'd guess the Middle East somewhere - Iraq or Iran or Egypt or thereabouts. He asked us if we wanted to wait for a four-wheel drive vehicle, but the Uber app said, "None available," so he took us, saying, "I'm a really good driver in snow." Sure, you learned that in a country that has zero snow ever. In the event, he was right. He was an excellent driver in the snow, which was good, because we went up several hills with a lot of snow on them.

We made it to the entrance of the development where we live. The driver said he would help us carry our bags to the house, but no way was he going to try driving there. He was right; he would likely not have been able to get out. We declined his offer and dragged our suitcases about a quarter of a mile through six inches of snow. Remember: Laurie is sick and getting sicker by the minute. We opened the garage door at about 12:45 a.m., almost three hours after we'd landed.&nbsp;

The one wise decision we'd made before we left ten days earlier was to not turn off the heat in the house. So the house was cool, but not freezing. We left the bags in the garage, turned the heat up, turned the electric blankets on and got into bed. Home, sweet home.

<h2>Flu Update</h2>
It's twelve days since Laurie came down with this flu. She says she has never been so sick in her life, and I believe it. It almost certainly was not COVID, since no one around her caught it and rapid transmission is the key marker of COVID these days. She never had a fever - another COVID symptom - nor trouble breathing nor the dry cough of COVID (but she surely had a cough; a terrible cough that lasted until just the last day or so).&nbsp;

Our doc and our resident infectious disease expert believe this was a case of the 2022 flu, and they also say that this year's flu is the most virulent in years. Laurie believes it! Almost two weeks after she felt the first symptoms, she's starting to feel human again.&nbsp;

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yowzers John!!!  First of all, you’re a gifted writer!  Since I’m a word-bunch reader, I skim. Your writing allows me to see exactly everything word-for-word!  Thank you.  What a journey indeed!  I loved hearing about Annie’s love, Clara’s new ‘do’, Derek’s up’do’, the travel debacle!!  I’ll share with Mike, of course.  He’ll no doubt hone in on your family history!  We hope Laurie feels better by the day.  Sick isn’t fun, but on the road is downright unkind!!

A side note re: Lisa’s journey to TX Christmas night.  She &amp; Morgan had awful weather on the way to SLC!!  Her former brother-in-law actually intercepted her &amp; ‘escorted’ via car ‘til they were safe.  That whole family grew up in that weather.  She made her flight with 10 minutes to spare!  Mother Nature is always first😳

Glad you’re home safely.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After the most miserable Winter and Spring imaginable here in Seattle, we headed off to St. Louis in May to catch up on grandkid-hugging, tiki-drinking, general good fun and some warm weather. We had a&nbsp;great time!

First: here's the St. Louis family:

<h2>A Ramble to Cahokia Mounds</h2>
A thousand years ago, Cahokia - just east across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, was home to around 20,000 people, with stockade walls, many buildings, and the mounds. These mounds were built for defensive and religious purposes, as well as burials of important people. There are over 100 mounds ranging from little bumps to Monks Mound: 900 feet long, 700 feet wide and 95 ft high, constructed from 22 million cubic feet of dirt, all dug up by hand and carried to the site in baskets (no excavators or dump trucks in the 12th century, when the most building activity occurred!).

This was an enjoyable ramble. The Interpretive Center was closed for renovation, and we'll return when it re-opens, as we hear it has lots of interesting history and information. Some pictures of the biggest mound:

<h2>Gardening</h2>
One thing Craig and Annie do not have is a lot of time to garden, so we helped out. They had done a lot of work to planted new flowering plants and shrubs which will look great in a year or two; now, though, weeds were taking over. So Laurie and I had at them and cleaned up a couple plant beds. The frustrating part was, as always, a week later the weeds were back so we did it again. Still, we were glad to be able to help.

All the plants are Missouri natives and should grow well in the terrible clay soil that makes up their yard. They did a lot of work to get these and the front yard shrubs and flowers planted - it'll be fun to watch them grow and flower.[/caption]
<h2>A Ramble to Memphis, Missouri</h2>
Memphis, Missouri, 10 miles south of the Iowa border, is not&nbsp;<em>anything</em> like the big Memphis in Tennessee. Memphis, Missouri is maybe 1,800 people, no spectacular sights (actually, no sights at all); really, no reason for us to visit except...

...my great-grandparents lived there for many years and my grandfather (Jacob Wendell Zumsteg) was born there. We figured that was reason enough to visit Memphis, Missouri, so we detoured on a drive to Kansas City to do a little ancestor-tracking in Memphis.&nbsp;

We went first to the cemetery to see if we could find some Zumsteg graves we knew are there. We figured it would be a small cemetery and we'd have no problem. Not so; it was big, being the main cemetery for the county and surrounding areas. We had a section number for the Zumsteg graves, but the sections weren't marked, so we just tramped &nbsp;around. We found one Zumsteg tombstone, with graves for some siblings of my grandfather but we could not find that of my great-grandparents. Since it was about 90° and midwest-humid, we gave it up and drove into town.

First visit there: the library. A very nice librarian pulled out a binder that had records of all the graves in the cemetery and a map of it! I took a picture so we could go back and find what we were looking for. Gotta love a small-town library!

As near as we could tell, there are only two restaurants in Memphis and one was nearby, so we went there for lunch. Here's one page of the menu; check the prices.

I've said the day of the $10 cheeseburger is gone, but not in Memphis, MO. Check that out: $6.50 for a <em>double</em> cheeseburger. Highest price for a sandwich: $5.75. Laurie and I each had a sandwich (Reuben for her, turkey club for me), ice tea (no alcohol available) and we split a large order of fries. Total cost: $18.71. Not for each of us, total cost. And the sandwiches were just fine.

Back to the cemetery. With our map in hand, we quickly located the graves we were looking for:

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_4966-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7668" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_4966-1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"></a>
My great-grandparents emigrated from the Aargau region of Switzerland - just a mile from the German border - in 1853. We think they went first to St. Louis, where others from that region who had emigrated&nbsp;earlier lived. In the 1870s they moved to Memphis. Why? We have no idea. We talked to a woman in the hardware store on the main square (okay, the only square) and she remembers hearing that the Zumsteg family ran the pharmacy in the early-1900s. I have found nothing to confirm that, but she said she had a small glass bottle, used to store a liquid medicine or lotion, that had "Zumsteg" engraved on it, so that could be. My grandfather was born here in Memphis in 1881.

Memphis is the county seat, so this courthouse, with a rather odd dome(?) is in the center of town.[/caption]

We visited the courthouse where a very nice young man spent about 45 minutes digging through old property records to see if we could learn where the Zumstegs lived. We are not 100% sure, but we think the house below is where a great-uncle and his family lived. It's likely built on land owned by the family since the 1870s and replaces an earlier house. But that's mostly speculation. That last Zumsteg in Memphis, my grandfather's youngest brother, left the town in the 1940s, moving to California, where he died in 1958.

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02427.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7677" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02427.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="451"></a>That's Memphis, Missouri. Honestly, I can't see a reason you'd visit it unless you too have ancestors there. But honestly, we loved visiting it and seeing where my great-grandparents lived and where my grandfather and his siblings were born.&nbsp;
<h2>Kansas City and Independence</h2>
After Memphis we drove to Independence, a good-sized city right next to Kansas City, on the western edge of Missouri. When we decided to go there, we had a purpose: to see the National Frontier Trails Museum. Both readers of this blog will remember that Laurie and I are "rut nuts:" enthusiasts of the Oregon and California trails used by emigrants in the 1840s-1860s to move from the East Coast to California, Oregon and Washington. In the early days of emigration, Independence was the jumping-off place for the three main trails - the two mentioned above and the Santa Fe Trail, to Santa Fe, New Mexico.&nbsp;

If you're in the area and interested in the trails, this museum is worth a visit. It has exhibits on the three trails as well as on the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some pix:

Imagine loading this with enough food for four-five months and heading off into the unknown.[/caption]

We have a connection to stars of trail research: Irene Paden and her husband Bill, who spent many summers tracing the route of the California Trail. She wrote two excellent and well-known books about their travels and research on the California Trail. We're interested in her because the Padens were best friends with my Arfsten grandparents for many years in Alameda, CA. My grandmother lived with Irene for several years when I was in high-school and when visiting my grandmother I was able to spend time in the basement of Irene's house, which was chock-full of relics and artifacts they'd picked up on the trail over the years.

I learned that their collection had been donated to the Oregon-California Trails Association, which had then donated it to the National Frontier Trails Museum. I thought maybe some of that collection would be on display, but found just one small thing.

[caption id="attachment_7681" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02439-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7681 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02439-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="393"></a> A knife from the Irene Paden collection.[/caption]

The museum has just hired a collections manager and we're hopeful that more of Irene's collection will be on display in the future.

We also stopped in at the Oregon-California Trails Association office, which is next door to the museum. There we had an enjoyable conversation with a woman who has worked for OCTA for 30 years about OCTA and how much we enjoy being members. I asked about Irene Paden and she was able to show us all the information they had on her donation of the collection - inventories and descriptions of the items donated, clippings of news stories about it, pictures of the family. (The collection was actually donated by Irene's son several years after her death.) Definitely a fun and rewarding stop on our trip.
<h1>Kansas City</h1>
Kansas City is a pretty cool place; we hope to explore it further on future trips. Our first stop was at a sculpture park associated with the Atkins-Nelson Art Museum. We were drawn here because the park has one of two Andy Goldsworthy walls (the other is in Storm King, New York. We visited that in 2019). This wall is not as long as Storm King's, but we loved it.&nbsp;

<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02453.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7683 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02453.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a>

[caption id="attachment_7684" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02454.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7684 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC02454.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></a> We can't say why we love the Andy Goldsworthy walls, but we do. Maybe that's art: you don't have to analyze why you like something. No matter what, these walls really touch us.[/caption]
<h2>World War I Museum</h2>
Who'd've thunk there is a World War I museum in Kansas City, but there is: a spectacular one. It was overwhelming, really. I have no good pictures of it to show you. Laurie lasted about two hours, while I could have spent a full day here.
<h2>One last thing to do in Kansas City/Independence</h2>
[caption id="attachment_7687" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_4999.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7687 size-full" src="http://zumsteg.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_4999.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a> Ribs, brisket, chicken, beans, cole-slaw, white cheddar mac-and-cheese, potato salad and white toast. It was great![/caption]
<h2>Big News</h2>
While we were in St. Louis, Craig was interviewed for a campaign position by a candidate for the Missouri Senate. He got the job, which was exciting for all of us, and a little nervous-making for Craig. He'll be responsible for "field operations," which means getting canvassers, phone callers and postcard writers, training and scheduling them, and increasing the candidate's presence in the district. Although Missouri is a fairly conservative state (think Josh Hawley. No wait, don't think Josh Hawley; it'll fry your brain), the district his candidate is running in is definitely of the blue persuasion, so Craig says she has an excellent chance of winning. Craig was involved in campaigns in New York, and this is his first real paid job in the field. Pretty cool, we think.
<h2>Dream Daughter-in-law</h2>
We have always said that Annie is the best daughter-in-law ever. One morning, Laurie was having a late sleep when came a knock on the door. She opened it and there stood Annie and Henry, with a freshly-made latte for Laurie. Is that the sweetest thing ever?&nbsp;

That's the wrap-up on our latest St. Louis sojourn. We were in Missouri for a little over two weeks, and we had a great time. We're already looking forward to our Christmas trip to St. Louis.
<h2>P.S. Uncle Wiggily</h2>
Do any of you remember the Uncle Wiggily Longears books and stories? I remember having them read to me as a child and I read them to our kids. We brought an old Uncle Wiggily book of stories to read to Henry, expecting that he would find them too boring and slow. Wrong! He really enjoyed them and every night asked us to read a story.

Now for a bit of Uncle Wiggily trivia.The author, Howard Garis, worked for a newspaper and in 1910 wrote the first Uncle Wiggily story for the paper. He then wrote an Uncle Wiggily story every day, six days a week,&nbsp;<em>for fifty-two years!&nbsp;</em>(That is somewhere around 16,000 Uncle Wiggily stories!)

It was really fun to have Henry enjoy the Uncle Wiggily stories. And if the rabbit gentleman and Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy don't fall into a vat of molasses and cause the postman to drop his mailbag, scattering postcards all over town, I'll post something about our next trip - whenever and wherever that is.]]></content:encoded>
